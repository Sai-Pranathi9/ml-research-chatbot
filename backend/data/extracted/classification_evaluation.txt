We demonstrate the ﬁrst application of a liquid-metal ion source for collinear laser spectroscopy
in proof-of-principle measurements on naturally abundant In+.
The superior beam quality, i.e.,
the actively stabilized current and energy of a beam with very low transverse emittance, allowed
us to perform precision spectroscopy on the 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 intercombination transition in
115In+, which is to our knowledge the slowest transition measured with collinear ﬂuorescence laser
spectroscopy so far. By applying collinear and anticollinear spectroscopy, we improved the center-of-
gravity frequency νcg = 1 299 617 759. 3 (1.2) and the hyperﬁne constants A = 6957.19 (28) MHz and
B = −443.7 (2.4) MHz by more than two orders of magnitude. A similar accuracy was reached for
113In+ in combination with literature data and the isotope shift between both naturally abundant
isotopes was deduced to ν(113In) −ν(115In) = 696.3 (3.1) MHz.
Nuclear alignment induced by
optical pumping in a preparation section of the ion beamline was demonstrated as a pump-and-
probe approach to provide sharp features on top of the Doppler broadened resonance proﬁle.

INTRODUCTION
Sources for atomic, ionic and molecular beams ﬁnd ap-
plications in many ﬁelds of research. In this paper, we
describe the ﬁrst utilization of a liquid-metal ion source
(LMIS) for collinear laser spectroscopy and present char-
acterizing measurements using an In+ beam. Due to the
superior performance, such ion sources found a multi-
tude of applications, ranging from focused-ion-beam mi-
croprobes over mask/circuit repair and manipulation to
lithography (see e.g. [1–4] and references therein). Due
to their compact design, high reliability and low main-
tenance requirements, these sources are even used as ion
thrusters for space crafts [5, 6]. They are able to deliver
ion currents of up to several mA, which allows to reduce
the transverse emittance signiﬁcantly by trimming the
beam [7]. Operation with a few pure elements is pos-
sible, among them especially indium and gallium, which
have very low melting points and low vapor pressures, but
there are many suitable eutectic alloys containing most
metallic elements [8].
This also allows the production
of molecular beams of various charge states. While most
metallic ions are also accessible with standard plasma ion
sources like electron cyclotron resonance ion sources or
Penning ion sources, these advantages and the relatively
low cost make LMIS an interesting alternative.
We will report on the adaption of a liquid-metal ion
source for the needs of collinear laser spectroscopy and
present atomic spectra obtained from beams of natural
abundant indium. Our realization actively stabilizes ion
current and ion energy, leading to optimal conditions for
these experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate laser
spectroscopy in the deep UV, which sets high demands,

particularly on laser system and ﬂuorescence detection,
and present optical pumping schemes that allow spec-
troscopy on narrow spectral features to overcome preci-
sion limits due to broad resonance signals.
We chose In+ for the characterization measurements
since the 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 intercombination transition
at 230.6 nm is still accessible with standard laser systems
and the narrow linewidth of 360 kHz makes it an interest-
ing candidate for laser-based high-voltage metrology [7].
The transition is still strong enough to perform collinear
ﬂuorescence laser spectroscopy, but is to our knowledge
the slowest transition investigated with that technique so
far.
At other facilities, collinear laser spectroscopy was per-
formed over a wide range of indium isotopes, particularly
to investigate nuclear properties close to the Z = 50 shell
closure [9–11]. However, in all cases atomic beams were
used. Therefore, we will evaluate the accessibility of the
ionic state for complementary measurements. This is of
special interest for the hyperﬁne structure parameters A
and B, where disagreement was found between experi-
ment and theory in recent studies of atomic 5p →ns
transitions [12]. This indicates an increased importance
of electron correlations in the excited atomic states. In
the ion, the hyperﬁne interaction is about an order of
magnitude stronger than in the atomic states and might
therefore be a guide for improved coupled cluster calcu-
lations. So far, only a few ionic transitions have been
measured with high precision.
Among them, the for-
bidden 5s2
1S0 →5s5p 3P0 transition, which is em-
ployed for optical clocks [13, 14]. In this context, also
one hyperﬁne component (F = 9/2 →F ′ = 11/2) of the
5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 intercombination transition has been
precisely measured as it is routinely employed as cooling
transition [15]. The other components and, hence, the
A and B factors are known with signiﬁcant lower accu-
racies. We were able to improve those by two orders of
magnitude.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The
measurements
were
conducted
at
the
new
Collinear Apparatus for Laser Spectroscopy and Applied
Science (COALA) at TU Darmstadt. We identiﬁed the
rest-frame transition frequencies ν0 of all three hyperﬁne
transitions (F = 9/2 →F ′ = 7/2, 9/2, 11/2) of 115In+ via
collinear/anticollinear spectroscopy:
νc · νa = ν0γ(1 + β) · ν0γ(1 −β) = ν2
0
(1)
where νc and νa are the collinear and anticollinear laser
frequencies at resonance with the Doppler-shifted tran-
sition frequency, β is the ion velocity and γ the time-
dilation factor. A detailed description of the experimen-
tal realization including all applied ion sources, beamline
and laser systems is given in [7].
Here, we will give a brief explanation with a focus
on the operation of the liquid-metal ion source (LMIS)
and the beam preparation, since to our knowledge such
a source has not been used in collinear spectroscopy pre-
viously. As depicted in Fig. 1, the LMIS and the asso-
ciated power supplies are ﬂoated on a high-voltage plat-
form from which the In+ ion beam is emitted with a total
kinetic energy of 15 keV to the beamline at ground po-
tential. The LMIS was developed and assembled at TU
Dresden [16].
Between the emitter module, consisting
of a capillary (50 µm bore diameter) on top of a heated
reservoir ﬁlled with indium, and an extractor electrode in
a few mm distance, a potential diﬀerence of about 5.2 kV
is applied. The electric ﬁeld is strong enough to ionize
the liquid metal, which is fed through the capillary and
the generated ions are then accelerated by the same ﬁeld
[3, 17]. We stabilize the emitted ion current by operat-
ing the power supply ﬂoating the emitter module at a
current limit of typically 10 µA. This evokes voltage ﬂuc-
tuations which we counteract by adapting the potential
of the high-voltage platform, leading to an ion beam with
constant current and ion energy.
Even though the beam emitted from an LMIS has
a large divergence [18, 19], it can be used to generate
beams with very low transverse emittance, since it orig-
inates from a spot with diameter of less than 100 nm.
We restrict the beam to a 2-mm diameter aperture in
a distance of 200 mm from the emitter and estimate a
normalized emittance of 10–50π mm mrad
√
eV by com-
paring the transmission through the pinhole with the di-
vergence angles measured with a similar LMIS [7, 20].
After trimming most of the ion beam, the remaining 2-
nA beam passes a ceramic high-voltage break and is col-
limated by an Einzel lens in 150 mm distance, ﬁnally pro-
viding a beam with a longitudinal spread of 22 eV. Larger
ion currents can be achieved by using larger apertures or
larger emitter currents. We tested stable operation of up
to 250 µA (before the aperture) that comes at the cost of
a larger longitudinal energy spread [1].
The longitudinal velocity distribution leads to Doppler
broadening which is signiﬁcantly compressed by the
acceleration to 15 keV. Nevertheless, already a kinetic

FIG. 1.
Adaption of a liquid-metal ion source for collinear
laser spectroscopy. The ion current is kept constant by reg-
ulating the voltage applied to the emitter module while the
total ion energy is stabilized by adapting the potential of the
high voltage platform. It turned out that it is important to
operate the trimming aperture on the same potential as the
LMIS, since secondary electrons, generated by ion impinge-
ment, are otherwise accelerated back to the source. This de-
teriorates the ion-beam stability strongly [21, 22]. In our case,
the relatively slow electrons can be deﬂected by ﬂoating the
extractor plate on a negative potential of −300 V. Behind the
aperture a ceramic insulator connects the source to the beam-
line at ground potential. The ion beam is collimated by an
Einzel lens.
energy width of 22 eV causes a linewidth of about
500 MHz which is much larger than the natural linewidth
of 360 kHz of the investigated intercombination transi-
tion. This can be cured by using, e.g., gas-ﬁlled radio-
frequency traps to cool the beam that are installed at
many other laser spectroscopy facilities.
As an alter-
native, we present a proof-of-principle realization of a
pump-and-probe scheme that creates sharp spectral fea-
tures on top of the Doppler broadened transition.
After a 10 ◦bend, we superimpose the ion beam with
the laser beams that are either copropagating (collinear)
or counterpropagating (anticollinear) to the ion beam.
After passing through ion optics for beam manipulation,
an iris aperture with adjustable size localizes the position
of all beams. In a distance of 2.6 m downstream, a second
iris is installed, hence deﬁning angle and position of all
beams. Several arrays of drift tubes and a ﬂuorescence
detection region (FDR) that can be ﬂoated on individual
potentials, are placed between the apertures. In particu-
lar, a ﬁrst 1.2-m long drift tube enables optical manipu-
lations of the ion beam. A second 0.17-m long drift tube
is placed directly in front of the FDR and can be used for
probing slow transitions. Our FDR is especially designed
for spectroscopy in the deep UV-range and the combina-
tion of imaging and non-imaging optics leads to a passive
background suppression [24]. Photons that are emitted
from the ion beam are collected with a mirror array cov-
ering a solid angle of nearly 4π and counted with photo-
multiplier tubes. The relatively long lifetime of 440 ns of
the excited state of the investigated 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1
intercombination transition in combination with the fast
ion beam that travels at a speed of 16 cm/µs allows us to
probe the transition in the drift tube in front of the FDR,
shutter the laser beam with an acousto-optical modula-
tor (AOM) and monitor the ﬂuorescence photons while

the laser is blocked. This completely eliminates the oth-
erwise dominant background from scattered laser light.
The laser system consists of two Sirah Matisse 2 TS
Ti:Sapphire lasers, which are operated at 920 nm and
pumped with 19 W of 532-nm light from two Spectra
Physics Millennia eV lasers each. The light is quadru-
pled in four cavity-based frequency doublers (Spectra
Physics, Wavetrain 2) yielding up to 100 mW of 230-nm
light. Both Ti:Sapphire lasers are locked to a Menlo Sys-
tems FC1500-250-WG frequency comb by a new locking
scheme developed in cooperation with both manufactur-
ers (see [7] for more details). The results presented here,
are the ﬁrst application of this locking scheme, achieving
a stability of about 60 kHz for the fundamental frequency
at a time scale of minutes. Due to the direct lock to a fre-
quency standard via the comb, long-term drifts are sup-
pressed. The UV light is sent through spatial ﬁlters to
create collimated TEM00 beams, which are then guided
5 m through air to the downstream end of the beamline.
While the anticollinear laser beam is directly transmitted
through a plane uncoated quartz window into the beam-
line, the collinear laser beam is transported another 5.5 m
through air parallel to the beamline, before injecting the
beam in opposite direction into the collinear apparatus
through a similar window.

RESULTS
We
investigated
the
intercombination
transition
5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 of In+ in order to use this tran-
sition for high-voltage metrology [7]. It consists of three
hyperﬁne transitions (F = 9/2 →F ′ = 7/2, 9/2, 11/2) sep-
arated by about 35 GHz, whereof the last one is the so-
called cooling transition for optical clocks based on In+.
As demonstrated in [25], we could clearly resolve both
naturally abundant isotopes. However, we focused only
on the more abundant 115In isotope (95.7 %) since we
can deduce all relevant parameters for 113In from precise
nuclear ratios measured in [26, 27].
While our setup is optimized for the anticollinear ge-
ometry, resulting in low background rates of only 10 kHz
for a laser power of 1 mW, it is worse by a factor of 25
in the collinear case. As mentioned above, we used the
drift tube in front of the ﬂuorescence detection region for
probing the ions. This was realized by Doppler tuning,
i.e., the lasers are stabilized to a ﬁxed frequency while
the potential of the drift tube is scanned. The change
of the ion velocity leads to varying Doppler shifts that
are used to scan across the resonance. The ﬂuorescence
detection region was ﬂoated on a diﬀerent potential to
avoid laser-ion interactions outside the drift tube. We
compared ﬂuorescence detection under these conditions
with direct excitation inside the FDR. According to the
relative signal strength, 14 % of the photons are still de-
tected when exciting the ion beam only inside the drift
tube. In Fig. 2a the optical response for the excitation
of the In+ beam in cw mode in anticollinear geometry
inside the drift tube is shown.
Due to the low back-
ground rate in this direction, a high signal-to-noise ratio
of 22:1 is achieved within 8 min of accumulation time. In
Fig. 2b, a resonance spectrum taken in collinear geome-
try with a shuttered laser beam, is depicted. The beam-
on/beam-oﬀperiods were chosen as 10 µs/2 µs explaining
the smaller signal strength for the same accumulation
time.
Due to the drastically reduced background, the
signal-to-noise ratio is slightly improved to 25:1 despite
the high background rates in this direction. We identiﬁed
the remaining background - unfortunately after the ex-
periment - to be caused by the vacuum gauges. Turning
those oﬀwill allow us to record practically background-
free spectra in the future. In both cases, the resonances
have a width of ΓFWHM ≈500 MHz and their resonance
frequency can be determined with a statistical uncer-
tainty of approximately 4 MHz from the ﬁt. The Voigt
proﬁle ﬁtted to the experimental data is dominated by
the Gaussian contribution which conﬁrms the expecta-
tions on the ion production process regarding the initial
4
velocity distribution.
For the precise determination of the three hyperﬁne
transitions, we superimposed collinear and anticollinear
lasers as well as the ion beam. The alignment of both
laser beams could be easily checked in front of the anti-
collinear window where both beams arrive from the laser
lab. Comparing the spot positions from one laser before
and from the other after passing through the beamline
and vice versa in a distance of 10 m, enables an excel-
lent superposition of both laser beams. Their size was
adjusted to a diameter of 2 mm to match with the ion
beam size. By using the adjustable iris diaphragms in-
side the beamline, the ion-laser overlap was optimized.
For the determination of the rest-frame transition fre-
quencies, a series of alternately performed collinear (c)
and anticollinear (a) measurements was taken. To pre-
clude uncertainties from unresolved long-term drifts, the
applied measurement scheme was a-c-c-a.
As demon-
strated in Eq. 1, the rest-frame transition frequency ν0
can be determined by multiplying the resonant frequen-
cies νc and νa obtained in collinear and anticollinear mea-
surements, respectively, if both are detected from an ion
beam with identical velocity β. But since Doppler tun-
ing is applied, the ion velocity is varied and this equation
is not applicable as long as the two resonances do not
appear at exactly the same scan voltage. Therefore, we
chose both frequencies in a way that the resonance signal
appeared at almost the same scan voltage. The remain-
ing small deviation of the resonant scan voltage ∆Uscan
is corrected by linearly approximating its impact on the
frequency of one laser

Here, also the shift due to the photon recoil ∆νrecoil ≈
hν2
0/2mc2 = 33 kHz is taken into account. Due to the
long lifetime, we do not expect more than one interac-
tion.
With this method the rest-frame transition fre-
quencies between the ground state and all three hyperﬁne
states of the 5s5p 3P1 level were measured. The results
are listed in Tab. I. By taking seven pairs of collinear
and anticollinear measurements for the transition to the
F ′ = 11/2 state and nine pairs for the transitions to the
F ′ = 9/2 and F ′ = 7/2 states at the same day, the statis-
tical uncertainty was reduced to 1.2 MHz, 1.4 MHz and
1.5 MHz, respectively.
This corresponds to the uncer-
tainty of the weighted average that is slightly larger than
the standard deviation of the mean. The systematic un-
certainty is estimated to be less than 1.5 MHz.
As demonstrated in [28, 29] it is generally possible to
reduce the systematic uncertainty to 100 kHz at COALA.
However, the energy distribution of the ion beam used in
those measurements was below 100 meV compared to the
TABLE I. Rest-frame transition frequencies and hyperﬁne pa-
rameters A and B of the 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 transition in
115In+. Our values are in excellent agreement with ion-trap
measurements [15, 30] but provide considerably improved ac-
curacy in most cases.
The measurement performed with a
monochromator [31] shows a systematic deviation of almost
300 MHz, indicating a wrong calibration of their apparatus.
This was also pointed out in a re-evaluation of the avail-
able literature data [32], in which a recalibrated value for the
center-of-gravity frequency νcg was published.

width of about 22 eV in our case. The dynamical proper-
ties of the electrostatic 10 ◦deﬂector used to superimpose
both beams, act as an energy ﬁlter and distribute ions
with diﬀerent kinetic energies in a direction perpendicu-
lar to the ion beam direction in the horizontal plane. A
misalignment between ion and laser beams can lead to a
partial overlap of ion and laser beam and exclude a part
of the velocity distribution from the interaction with the
laser light. If the two laser beams diﬀer in position or
diameter, this asymmetry might aﬀect both spectra (a,c)
diﬀerently and, hence, can cause uncorrelated shifts when
extracting the centroid frequencies. To quantify this un-
certainty, a series of collinear/anticollinear measurements
was performed with the overlap of both beams worsened
on purpose. The spectra were ﬁtted with an asymmetric
proﬁle [23] which becomes necessary for a proper descrip-
tion of the data as shown exemplary in Fig. 2c. Besides
a higher statistical uncertainty of 2.2 MHz, the center of
the rest-frame transition frequency extracted from these
measurements is shifted by 1.5 MHz compared to the re-
sults listed in Tab. I. Even though this shift is within the
statistical uncertainty bands, it is conservatively consid-
ered as systematic contribution to account for possible
deviations due to the asymmetric shape caused by a par-
tial overlap of ion and laser beams.

DISCUSSION
Three groups have previously reported measurements
on the 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 transition of 115In+ neglecting
the measurement of Paschen and Campbell carried out
in 1938 [33]. Most recently Wang et al. [15] measured
the cooling transition (F = 9/2 →F ′ = 11/2) on a single
ion in a radio-frequency trap with an accuracy of 100 kHz
by using a frequency comb. Our value agrees well within
5
our uncertainty bands, which conﬁrms the accuracy of
our measurement. Another measurement performed in a
radio-frequency trap by Peik et al. [30] provided all hy-
perﬁne transitions but is not listed in Tab. I since they
speciﬁed large uncertainties of 600 MHz.
Nevertheless,
it should be noted that their values are in good agree-
ment and diﬀer by less than 90 MHz to our results. A
smaller uncertainty of 150-180MHz is stated by Larkins
and Hannaford [31] who performed measurements using
an chelle monochromator. However, their values show
a systematic deviation of about 280 MHz to our results
and to those from Wang and coworkers. A similar devi-
ation of 277 MHz has been observed in the clock transi-
tion (5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P0) at 236.5 nm [13]. As pointed
out in detail by Kramida [32], who summarized and
re-evaluated all spectroscopic data of In+, the calibra-
tion of the monochromator and the conversion from the
air wavelength into vacuum wavenumbers of [31] can be
strongly aﬀected by underestimated systematic eﬀects.
Based on the accurate value of [15], Kramida recalibrated
these measurements and gave a value for the center of
gravity of the 5s2 1S0 →5s5p 3P1 transition [32]. From
our values we can also deduce the center-of-gravity fre-
quency νcg as well as the hyperﬁne parameters A and B.
These have been calculated analytically from

2AC + B

(4)
where ∆ν denotes the frequency diﬀerence from the indi-
vidual hyperﬁne transitions to the center of gravity and
C = F(F + 1) −I(I + 1) −J(J + 1). Our results are
included in Tab. I. Only Peik et al. explicitly stated the
hyperﬁne parameters in their work (see Tab. I) but these
can be deduced from Larkins and Hannaford’s values as
well (A = 6960 (26)MHz and B = −460 (190)MHz [31]).
Both are in excellent agreement with our results. More-
over, the re-evaluated center of gravity agrees nicely.
With the precise ratios of the magnetic dipole moment
µ [26] and electric quadrupole moment Q [27] between
115In and 113In
µ(115In+)/µ(113In+) = 1.0021437 (12)
Q(115In+)/Q(113In+) = 1.0138236 (13)
we can calculate the hyperﬁne constants of 113In+ to
be A(113In+) = 6942.32(75)MHz and B(113In+) =
−437.7 (2.4)MHz.
We included an uncertainty contri-
bution considering a hyperﬁne structure anomaly, which
we estimate to be smaller than 0.01 % since both isotopes
have the same nuclear spin of I = 9/2 and because mea-
surements in the P1/2 and P3/2 states of atomic indium
revealed anomalies of only 7.5 · 10−6 and 23.8 · 10−6, re-
spectively [34].
The
hyperﬁne
constants
can
also
be
employed
to extract the isotope shift ν(113In) −ν(115In)
=
696.3(2)(3.1)MHz from the precise measurement of
Wang et al. [15]. The ﬁrst uncertainty value of 0.2 MHz
corresponds to the combined experimental uncertainty
of both experiments while the large systematic contribu-
tion of 3.1 MHz is an estimation of a possible hyperﬁne
structure anomaly contribution, being neglected in [15].
Based on experimental uncertainties only, they present
an uncertainty of 1.68 MHz but since the same analysis
is applied, this systematic contribution needs to be con-
sidered as well.
V.
PUMP-AND-PROBE MEASUREMENTS
In order to overcome the limitations caused by the
large velocity distribution inherent in the operation prin-
ciple of the LMIS or of other ion source with relatively
large energy spread, pump-and-probe measurements can
be applied. For a proof of principle, we demonstrated this
by operating the ﬁrst 1.2-m long drift tube at a constant
potential. One velocity class of the ion beam that is in
resonance with the laser, will interact and can be manip-
ulated. In the case of In+, there is no hyperﬁne structure
splitting in the 1S0 ground state. However, the hyperﬁne
interaction still allows us to use laser light to reshuﬄe
population between the mF = −9/2, −7/2, ..., +9/2 nu-
clear magnetic substates and to produce orientation or
alignment of the nuclear spin.
This property is con-
served while the ion travels to the ﬂuorescence detec-
tion region even though there is no guiding ﬁeld as it
is usually applied in collinear optical pumping measure-
ments, as demonstrated for example in [35, 36].
The
reason is the long relaxation time caused by the ions’
small magnetic moment being exclusively of nuclear ori-
gin, and the reduction of magnetic stray ﬁelds by proper
shielding with permalloy. Subsequent excitation of the
ions manipulated by the ﬁrst laser interaction will lead
to an increased or decreased ﬂuorescence rate depending
on the combination of laser polarizations that are used in
the pump and the probe process. A narrow peak or a dip
will appear accordingly on top of the Doppler broadened
main resonance.
We have realized this in a simple way using the same
linearly-polarized light for both, optical pumping in the
ﬁrst drift tube and probing in the FDR. Therefore, the
potential at the optical pumping region is chosen such
that the laser beam is in resonance with ions close to the
center of the Doppler broadened line. Then, the potential
at the FDR is scanned to perform Doppler tuning around
the center of the resonance. The peak or dip will only
appear if ions of the same velocity class are addressed in
both regions. The result is shown for all three hyperﬁne
transitions in Fig. 3.
The sharp spectral feature observed in all three cases
exhibits a width of about 14 MHz on top of the main reso-
nance. Please note that the x-axis spans only 60-100MHz
compared to the more than 1.6-GHz wide region in Fig. 2.
The width of the spectral feature is reduced by a factor
of 35 compared to the Doppler-broadened peak but still
considerably wider than the 360-kHz natural linewidth of
the transition. A substantial fraction of this is expected

FIG. 3. Spectral features imprinted on top of the main resonance of the diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions. By optically pumping
one velocity class in the 1.2-m long drift tube in front of the ﬂuorescence detection region (FDR), the population of the magnetic
substates is altered, which is detected with the same laser by scanning the potential applied to the FDR. In all cases, linearly
polarized laser light is used. The direction of the features (peak or dip) and the relative intensity depends on the transition
strengths of the diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions.
to be caused by transit-time broadening and – to a lesser
extent – saturation broadening. Transit-time broadening
with a square-wave on/oﬀ-resonance condition which is
given by the fast entrance and exit of the ions into the
resonant potential inside the FDR, causes a sin2(x)/x2-
like lineshape. This function on top of a broad Gaussian
has been used for the ﬁts depicted in Fig. 3 and is able
to successfully reproduce the measured proﬁle. Never-
theless, based on the experimental conditions one would
expect the resonance to be a factor of three narrower as
it is observed. The reason for the additional broadening
is not fully understood yet.
On the other hand, the characteristic of the feature in
terms of sign (dip or peak) and relative intensity agrees
well with calculations based on the transition strength
between the diﬀerent mF states (Clebsch-Gordan coef-
ﬁcients) [25].
The partial strength of ∆mF = ±1 de-
cays in the F = 9/2 →F ′ = 11/2 transition favors de-
cay towards smaller |mF | values, where most of the π-
transition strength is located. Therefore a peak is ob-
served in Fig. 3a.
While the preferred direction of de-
cay is the same in the F = 9/2 →F ′ = 9/2 transition,
the π-transition strength is concentrated on the transi-
tions with large |mF | values. Hence, the total transition
strength is weakened and a dip appears in Fig. 3b. Fi-
nally, in subﬁgure c, the dip is intuitively understandable
since π-excitation will transport the population eventu-
ally into the mF = ±9/2 states, which are dark states in
the F = 9/2 →F ′ = 7/2 transition under these condi-
tions. This approach was successfully applied for high-
voltage metrology measurements in [7].
Furthermore,
this linewidth reduction by a factor of 35 will allow even
more precise determinations of the centroid frequencies
and the systematic uncertainties due to a spatial energy
separation will be avoided.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
We demonstrated that liquid-metal ion sources are
well suited to generate metallic ion beams for high-
precision collinear laser spectroscopy experiments.
An
excellent transverse emittance was achieved by trimming
the beam. Despite the large longitudinal energy spread,
we were able to present measurements of the three hy-
perﬁne transitions at the MHz level. Such measurements
could further be improved, as demonstrated here, with
the pump-and-probe technique.
The procedure is not
limited to beams from LMIS but will be useful for all
kind of beams from ion sources with large energy spread
like, e.g., electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) sources and
electron beam ion sources (EBIS). At COALA, we want
to apply the latter to produce He-like ions of beryllium to
carbon for laser spectroscopy in the 1s2s 3S1 →1s2p 3PJ
manifold.
Combined with high-precision atomic struc-
ture theory [37], we expect to extract accurate nuclear
charge radii directly from optical spectroscopy without
the need to refer to electron scattering or muonic atom
spectroscopy. Since the EBIS has a similar energy spread,
pump-and-probe techniques will play a crucial role to
reach the targeted accuracy of better than 1 MHz. De-
pending on the element and nuclear spin of the isotope
various techniques will be employed: saturation spec-
troscopy, Λ-spectroscopy or optical pumping as it was
demonstrated here.
