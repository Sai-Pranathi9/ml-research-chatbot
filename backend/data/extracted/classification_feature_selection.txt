general nonlinearities, we consider gradient systems and we establish regularity of the extremal solution in
dimensions n < 4s. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst regularity result on the extremal solution of nonlocal
system of equations.

when the function c(x, z) is bounded between two positive constants, 0 < c1 ≤c2, is studied extensively in
the literature from both theory of partial diﬀerential equations and theory of probability points of view, see
the book of Bass [1] and references therein. Integro-diﬀerential equations and systems, of the above form,
arise naturally in the study of stochastic processes with jumps, and more precisely in L´evy processes. A L´evy
process is a stochastic process with independent and stationary increments. A special class of such processes
is the so called stable processes. These are the processes that satisfy self-similarity properties, and they are

also the ones appearing in the Generalized Central Limit Theorem. We refer interested readers to the book
of Bertoin [2] for more information. The inﬁnitesimal generator of any isotropically symmetric stable L´evy
process in Rn is

where µ is any nonnegative and ﬁnite measure on the unit sphere Sn−1 called the spectral measure and
s ∈(0, 1). When the spectral measure is absolutely continuous, dµ(θ) = a(θ)dθ, the above operators can be
rewritten in the form of

for a positive constant cn,s is the simplest stable L´evy process for dµ(θ) = cn,sdθ. Note that the above
operator can be written in the form of (1.1) due to the fact that a is even. The regularity of solutions for
equation Lu = f has been studied thoroughly in the literature by many experts and in this regard we refer
interested to [1, 10, 25, 37, 41] and references therein. The most common assumption on the jump kernel in
this context is 0 < c1 ≤a(θ) ≤c2 in Sn−1 and occasionally a(θ) ≥c1 > 0 in a subset of Sn−1 with positive
measure. In this article, we consider the ellipticity assumption on the operator L of the form
(1.7)
0 < c1 ≤
inf
ν∈Sn−1
Z
Sn−1 |ν · θ|2sa(θ)dθ and 0 ≤a(θ) < c2 for all θ ∈Sn−1,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Note that regularity results (interior and boundary) under such an assumption
on general operator L is studied in the literature, and in this regard we refer interested readers to [37, 38]
and references therein. For particular nonlinearities of F and G, we consider the following Gelfand system

Note that for the case of p = 2 the above singular nonlinearity and system is known as the MicroElec-
troMechanical Systems (MEMS), see [19, 29] and references therein for the mathematical analysis of such
equations. In addition, we study the following gradient system with more general nonlinearities

The nonlinearities f and g will satisfy various properties but will always at least satisfy
(1.8)
f is smooth, increasing and convex with f(0) = 1 and f superlinear at inﬁnity.

A bounded weak solution pair (u, v) is called a classical solution when both components u, v are regular
in the interior of Ωand (P)λ,γ holds. Given a nonlinearity f which satisﬁes (1.8), the following nonlinear
eigenvalue problem
(Q)λ
 −∆u
=
λf(u)
in Ω,
u
=
0
on ∂Ω,
is now well-understood. Brezis and V´azquez in [4] raised the question of determining the boundedness of u∗
for general nonlinearities f satisfying (1.8). See, for instance, [3–6, 9, 11, 15, 34–36, 43] for both local and
nonlocal cases. It is known that there exists a critical parameter λ∗∈(0, ∞), called the extremal parameter,
such that for all 0 < λ < λ∗there exists a smooth, minimal solution uλ of (Q)λ. Here the minimal solution
means in the pointwise sense. In addition for each x ∈Ωthe map λ 7→uλ(x) is increasing in (0, λ∗). This
allows one to deﬁne the pointwise limit u∗(x) := limλրλ∗uλ(x) which can be shown to be a weak solution,
in a suitably deﬁned sense, of (Q)λ∗. For this reason u∗is called the extremal solution. It is also known
that for λ > λ∗, there are no weak solutions of (Q)λ. The regularity of the extremal solution has been of
great interests in the literature. There have several attempts to tackle the problem and here we list a few.
For a general nonlinearity f satisfying (1.8), Nedev in [35] proved that u∗is bounded when n ≤3. This was
extended to fourth dimensions when Ωis a convex domain by Cabr´e in [5]. The convexity of the domain was
relaxed by Villegas in [43]. Most recently, Cabr´e et al. in [7] claimed the regularity result when n ≤9. For
the particular nonlinearity f(u) = eu, known as the Gelfand equation, the regularity is shown u∗∈L∞(Ω)
for dimensions n < 10 by Crandall and Rabinowitz in [15], see also [21]. If Ωis a radial domain in Rn with
n < 10 the regularity is shown in [6] when f is a general nonlinearity satisfying conditions (1.8) but without
the convexity assumption. In view of the above result for the exponential nonlinearity, this is optimal. Note
that for the case of Ω= B1, the classiﬁcation of all radial solutions to this problem was originally done by
Liouville in [31] for n = 2 and then in higher dimensions in [28, 32, 34] and references therein. For power
nonlinearity f(u) = (1 + u)p and for singular nonlinearity f(u) = (1 −u)−p when 0 < u < 1 for p > 1,
known as the Lane-Emden equation and MEMS equation respectively, the regularity of extremal solutions
is established for the Joseph-Lundgren exponent, see [28], in the literature. We refer interested readers to
[15, 18–20, 26] and references therein for regularity results and Liouville theorems.
The regularity of extremal solutions for nonlocal eigenvalue problem,
(S)λ

(−∆)su

λf(u)
in Ω,
u
=

on Rn \ Ω,
is studied in the literature, see [11, 36, 39, 40], when 0 < s < 1. However, there are various questions
remaining as open problems. Ros-Oton and Serra in [36] showed that for a general nonlinearity f, u∗is
bounded when n < 4s. In addition, if the following limit exists
(1.9)
lim
t→∞
f(t)f ′′(t)
|f ′(t)|2
< ∞,
then u∗is bounded when n < 10s.
Note that speciﬁc nonlinearities f(u) = eu, f(u) = (1 + u)p and
f(u) = (1 −u)−p for p > 1 satisfy the above condition (1.9). When s →1, the dimension n < 10 is optimal.
However, for the fractional Laplacian n < 10s is not optimal, see Remark 5.1. In the current article, we prove
counterparts of these regularity results for system of nonlocal equations. Later in [39], Ros-Oton considered
the fractional Gelfand problem, f(u) = eu, on a domain Ωthat is convex in the xi-direction and symmetric
with respect to {xi = 0}, for 1 ≤i ≤n. As an example, the unit ball satisﬁes these conditions. And he
proved that u∗is bounded for either n ≤2s or n > 2s and
(1.10)
Γ( n
2 )Γ(1 + s)
Γ( n−2s
2
)
> Γ2( n+2s
4
)
Γ2( n−2s
4
).
This, in particular, implies that u∗is bounded in dimensions n ≤7 for all s ∈(0, 1). The above inequality
is expected to provide the optimal dimension, see Remark 5.1.
Relaxing the convexity and symmetry
conditions on the domain remains an open problem. Capella et al. in [11] studied the extremal solution of a
problem related to (S)λ in the unit ball B1 with a spectral fractional Laplacian operator that is deﬁned using
Dirichlet eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator in B1. They showed that u∗∈L∞(B1)

i
. More recently, Sanz-Perela in [40] proved regularity of the extremal
solution of (S)λ with the fractional Laplacian operator in the unit ball with the same condition on n and
s. This implies that u∗is bounded in dimensions 2 ≤n ≤6 for all s ∈(0, 1). Note also that it is well-
known that there is a correspondence between the regularity of stable solutions on bounded domains and
the Liouville theorems for stable solutions on the entire space, via rescaling and a blow-up procedure. For
the classiﬁcation of solutions of above nonlocal equations on the entire space we refer interested readers to
[12, 16, 24, 30], and for the local equations to [19–21] and references therein.
For the case of systems, as discussed in [14, 22, 33], set Q := {(λ, γ) : λ, γ > 0} and deﬁne
(1.11)
U := {(λ, γ) ∈Q : there exists a smooth solution (u, v) of (P)λ,γ} .
We assume that F(0, 0), G(0, 0) > 0. A simple argument shows that if F is superlinear at inﬁnity for u,
uniformly in v, then the set of λ in U is bounded. Similarly we assume that G is superlinear at inﬁnity
for v, uniformly in u, and hence we get U is bounded. We also assume that F, G are increasing in each
variable. This allows the use of a sub/supersolution approach and one easily sees that if (λ, γ) ∈U then so
is (0, λ] × (0, γ]. One also sees that U is nonempty. We now deﬁne Υ := ∂U ∩Q, which plays the role of the
extremal parameter λ∗. Various properties of Υ are known, see [33]. Given (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ set σ := γ∗
λ∗∈(0, ∞)
and deﬁne
(1.12)
Γσ := {(λ, λσ) : λ∗
2 < λ < λ∗}.
We let (uλ, vλ) denote the minimal solution (P)λ,σλ for λ∗
2 < λ < λ∗. One easily sees that for each x ∈Ω
that uλ(x), vλ(x) are increasing in λ and hence we deﬁne
(1.13)
u∗(x) := lim
λրλ∗uλ(x) and v∗(x) := lim
λրλ∗vλ(x),
and we call (u∗, v∗) the extremal solution associated with (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ. Under some very minor growth
assumptions on F and G one can show that (u∗, v∗) is a weak solution of (P)λ∗,γ∗. For the rest of this
article we refer to (u∗, v∗) as (u, v). For the case of local Laplacian operator, Cowan and the author in [14]
proved that the extremal solution of (H)λ,γ when Ωis a convex domain is regular provided 1 ≤n ≤3 for
general nonlinearities f, g ∈C1(R) that satisfying (1.8). This can be seen as a counterpart of the Nedev’s
result for elliptic gradient systems. For radial solutions, it is also shown in [14] that stable solutions are
regular in dimensions 1 ≤n < 10 for general nonlinearities. This is a counterpart of the regularity result of
Cabr´e-Capella [6] and Villegas [43] for elliptic gradient systems. For the local Gelfand system, regularity of
the extremal solutions is given by Cowan in [13] and by Dupaigne et al. in [17] when n < 10.
Here are our main results. The following theorem deals with regularity of the extremal solution of nonlocal
Gelfand, Lane-Emden and MEMS systems.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose that Ωis a bounded smooth domain in Rn. Let (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ and L is given by (1.5)
where the ellipticity condition (1.7) holds and 0 < s < 1. Then, the associated extremal solution of (G)λ∗,γ∗,
(E)λ∗,γ∗and (M)λ∗,γ∗is bounded when
n < 10s,

(1.15)
n < 2s +

(1.16)
respectively.
The following theorem is a counterpart of the Nedev regularity result for nonlocal system (H)λ,γ.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that Ωis a bounded smooth convex domain in Rn. Assume that f and g satisfy
condition (1.8) and f ′(0), g′(0) > 0 when f ′(·), g′(·) are convex and
(1.17)

holds. Let (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ and L = (−∆)s for 0 < s < 1. Then, the associated extremal solution (u, v) of
(H)λ∗,γ∗is bounded where n < 4s.
In order to prove the above results, we ﬁrst establish integral estimates for minimal solutions of systems
with a general nonlocal operator L given by (1.1) when J is a nonnegative measurable even jump kernel.
Then, we apply nonlocal Sobolev embedding arguments to conclude boundedness of the extremal solutions.
Note that when λ = γ the systems (G)λ,γ, (E)λ,γ and (M)λ,γ turn into scalar equations.
Here is how this article is structured. In Section 2, we provide regularity theory for nonlocal operators. In
Section 3, we establish various stability inequalities for minimal solutions of systems with a general nonlocal
operator of the form (1.1) with a nonnegative measurable even jump kernel.
In Section 4, we provide
some technical integral estimates for stable solutions of systems introduced in the above. In Section 5, we
apply the integral estimates to establish regularity of extremal solutions for nonlocal Gelfand, Lane-Emden
and MEMS systems with exponential and power nonlinearities. In addition, we provide regularity of the
extremal solution for the gradient system (H)λ,γ with general nonlinearities and also for particular power
nonlinearities.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we provide regularity results not only to the fractional Laplacian, but also to more general
integro-diﬀerential equations. We omit the proofs in this section and refer interested readers to corresponding
references. Let us start with the following classical regularity result concerning embeddings for the Riesz
potential, see the book of Stein [42].
Theorem 2.1. Suppose that 0 < s < 1, n > 2s and f and u satisfy
u = (−∆)−sf
in Rn,
in the sense that u is the Riesz potential of order 2s of f. Let u, f ∈Lp(Rn) when 1 ≤p < ∞.
(i) For p = 1, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lq(Rn) ≤C||f||L1(Rn) for q =
n
n −2s.
(ii) For 1 < p < n
2s, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lq(Rn) ≤C||f||Lp(Rn) for q =
np
n −2ps.
(iii) For
n
2s < p < ∞, there exists a positive constant C such that
[u]Cβ(Rn) ≤C||f||Lp(Rn) for β = 2s −n
p ,
where [·]Cβ(Rn) denotes the Cβ seminorm.
Here the constant C depending only on n, s and p.
The above theorem is applied by Ros-Oton and Serra in [36] to establish the following regularity theory
for the fractional Laplacian. See also [37] for the boundary regularity results.
Proposition 2.1. Suppose that 0 < s < 1, n > 2s and f ∈C(¯Ω) where Ω⊂Rn is a bounded C1,1 domain.
Let u be the solution of
 (−∆)su

f
in Ω,
u

in Rn \ Ω.
(i) For 1 ≤r <
n
n−2s, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lr(Ω) ≤C||f||L1(Ω) for r <
n
n −2s.
(ii) For 1 < p < n
2s, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lq(Ω) ≤C||f||Lp(Ω) for q =
np
n −2ps.

2s < p < ∞, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Cβ(Ω) ≤C||f||Lp(Ω) for β = min

.
Here the constant C depending only on n, s, p, r and Ω.
For the case of n ≤2s, the fact that 0 < s < 1 implies that n = 1 and s ≥1
2. Note that in this case
the Green function G(x, y) is explicitly known. Therefore, G(·, y) ∈L∞(Ω) for s > 1
2 and in Lp(Ω) for all
p < ∞when s = 1
2. We summarize this as ||u||L∞(Ω) ≤C||f||L1(Ω) when n < 2s. In addition, for the case
of n = 2s, we conclude that ||u||Lp(Ω) ≤C||f||L1(Ω) for all p < ∞and ||u||L∞(Ω) ≤C||f||Lp(Ω) for p > 1.
In what follows we provide a counterpart of the above regularity result for general integro-diﬀerential
operators given by (1.5). These operators are inﬁnitessimal generators of stable and symmetric L´evy processes
and they are uniquely determined by a ﬁnite measure on the unit sphere Sn−1, often referred as the spectral
measure of the process.
When this measure is absolutely continuous, symmetric stable processes have
generators of the form (1.5) where 0 < s < 1 and a is any nonnegative function L1(Sn−1) satisfying a(θ) =
a(−θ) for θ ∈Sn−1. The regularity theory for general operators of the form (1.5) has been recently developed
by Fern´andez-Real and Ros-Oton in [25]. In order to prove this result, authors apply results of [27] to study
the fundamental solution associated to the operator L in view of the one of the fractional Laplacian.
Proposition 2.2. Let Ω⊂Rn be any bounded domain, 0 < s < 1 and f ∈L2(Ω). Let u be any weak
solution of
 Lu

f
in Ω,
u
=

in Rn \ Ω,
where the operator L is given by (1.5) and the ellipticity condition (1.7) holds. Assume that f ∈Lr(Ω) for
some r.
(i) For 1 < r < n
2s, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lq(Ω) ≤C||f||Lr(Ω) for q =
nr
n −2rs.
(ii) For r = n
2s, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||Lq(Ω) ≤C||f||Lr(Ω) for q < ∞.
(iii) For
n
2s < r < ∞, there exists a positive constant C such that
||u||L∞(Ω) ≤C||f||Lr(Ω).
Here the constant C depending only on n, s, r, Ωand ellipticity constants.
We end this section with this point that (u, v) is a weak solution of (P)λ,γ for u, v ∈L1(Ω) if F(u, v)δs ∈
L1(Ω) and G(u, v)δs ∈L1(Ω) where δ(x) = dist(x, Ω) and

when ζ, η and ζ, η are bounded in Ωand ζ, η ≡0 on ∂Ω. Any bounded weak solution is a classical solution,
in the sense that it is regular in the interior of Ω, continuous up to the boundary, and (P)λ,γ holds pointwise.
Note that for the case of local operators, that is s = 1, the above notion of weak solution is consistent with
the one introduced by Brezis et al. in [3, 4].
3. Stability inequalities
In this section, we provide stability inequalities for minimal solutions of system (P)λ,γ for various nonlin-
earities F and G. We start with the following technical lemma in regards to nonlocal operator L with even
symmetric kernel J.
6
Lemma 3.1. Assume that an operator L is given by (1.6) with a measurable symmetric kernel J(x, z) =
J(x −z) that is even. Then,
L(f(x)g(x)) = f(x)L(g(x)) + g(x)L(f(x)) −

Rn [f(x) −f(z)] [g(x) −g(z)] J(x −z)dxdz,
where f, g ∈C1(Rn) and the integrals are ﬁnite.
Proof. The proof is elementary and we omit it here.
□
We now establish a stability inequality for minimal solutions of system (P)λ,γ. Note that for the case of
local operators this inequality is established by the author and Cowan in [14] and in [22].
Proposition 3.1. Let (uλ, vλ) be a minimal solution of system (P)λ,γ such that uλ, vλ are increasing in λ.
Assume that J is a measurable even kernel and FvGu ≥0. Then,

4. Integral estimates for stable solutions
In this section, we establish some technical integral estimates for stable solutions of systems. Most of
the ideas and methods applied in this section are inspired by the ones developed in the literature, see for
example [17, 20, 21, 23, 24]. We start with the Gelfand system.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose that (u, v) is a solution of (G)λ,γ when the associated stability inequality (3.3) holds.
Then, there exists a positive constant Cλ,γ,|Ω| = C(λ, γ, |Ω|) such that
Z
Ω
eu+vdx ≤Cλ,γ,|Ω|.
Proof. Multiply the second equation of (G)λ,γ with eu −1 and integrate to get

In regards to the gradient system with superlinear nonlinearities satisfying (1.8) we establish an integral
estimate that yields L2(Ω) of the function f ′(u)g′(v). We then use this to conclude estimates on the nonlin-
earities of the gradient system. Our methods and ideas in the proof are inspired by the ones developed in
[14] and originally by Nedev in [35].
Lemma 4.7. Suppose that f and g both satisfy condition (1.8) and a := f ′(0) > 0 and b := g′(0) > 0.
Assume that f ′, g′ are convex and (1.17) holds. Let (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ and (u, v) denote the extremal solution
associated with (H)λ∗,γ∗. Then, there exists a positive constant C < ∞such that
Z
Ω
f ′(u)g′(v)(f ′(u) −a)(g′(v) −b) ≤C.
Proof. We obtain uniform estimates for any minimal solution (u, v) of (H)λ,γ on the ray Γσ and then one
sends λ ր λ∗to obtain the same estimate for (u∗, v∗). Let (u, v) denote a smooth minimal solution of (H)λ,γ
on the ray Γσ and put ζ := f ′(u) −a and η := g′(v) −b into (3.6) to obtain

Now set k to be suﬃciently large and substitute (4.22) and (4.23) in (4.21) to complete the proof. Note that
see that all the integrals in (4.21) are bounded independent of λ and γ.

5. Regularity of the extremal solution; Proof of Theorem 1.1-1.2
In this section, we apply the integral estimates established in the latter section to prove regularity results
for extremal solutions of systems mentioned in the introduction earlier.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We shall provide the proof for the case of n > 2s, since otherwise is straightfor-
ward. Let (u, v) be the smooth minimal solution of (G)λ,γ for λ∗
2 < λ < λ∗and γ∗
2 < γ < γ∗. From Lemma
4.1 we conclude that
(5.1)
Z

eu+vdx ≤Cλ,γ,|Ω|.

Therefore, for every t < 4 either X or Y must be bounded where X and Y are given by

Without loss of generality, assume that λ ≤γ implies that u ≤v and therefore eu is bounded in Lq(Ω) for
q = t + 1 < 5. Therefore, in light of Proposition 2.2 we have u ∈L∞(Ω) for
n
2s < 5 that is n < 10s.
Now, let (u, v) be the smooth minimal solution of (E)λ,γ for λ∗
2 < λ < λ∗and γ∗
2 < γ < γ∗. From Lemma
4.2 we conclude that
(5.4)
Z
Ω
(1 + u)p(1 + v)pdx ≤Cλ,γ,|Ω|.

Without loss of generality, assume that λ ≤γ implies that u ≤v and therefore (1 + u) is bounded in Lq(Ω)
for q = p + t. We now rewrite the system (E)λ,γ for the extremal solution (u, v) that is

case of Lane-Emden system (E)λ,γ. The proof for the case of (M)λ,γ is very similar and replies on applying
Lemma 4.3 and Lemma 4.6.
✷
Remark 5.1. Even though the above theorem is optimal as s →1, it is not optimal for smaller values of
0 < s < 1.
In this regard, consider the case of λ = γ and the Gelfand system turns into (−∆)su = λeu in the entire
space Rn. It is known that the explicit singular solution u∗(x) = log
1
|x|2s is stable solution of the scalar
Gelfand equation if and only if
Γ( n
2 )Γ(1 + s)
Γ( n−2s

)
Γ2( n−2s
4
),
for the constant
λ = 22s Γ( n
2 )Γ(1 + s)
Γ( n−2s
2
)
.
This implies that the extremal solution of the fractional Gelfand equation should be regular for
Γ( n
2 )Γ(1 + s)
Γ( n−2s
2
)
> Γ2( n+2s
4
)
Γ2( n−2s
4
).
In particular, the extremal solution should be bounded when n ≤7 for 0 < s < 1. We refer interested to
[36, 39] for more details. Now, consider the case of Lane-Emden equation (−∆)su = λup in the entire space
Rn. It is also known that the explicit singular solution us(x) = A|x|−
2s
p−1 where the constant A is given by
Ap−1 =

As s →1, the above inequality is consistent with the dimensions given in (1.15). For more information, we
refer interested readers to Wei and the author in [24] and Davila et al. in [16]. Given above, proof of the
optimal dimension for regularity of extremal solutions remains an open problem.
17
We now provide a proof for Theorem 1.2 that deals with a regularity result for the gradient system (H)λ,γ
with general nonlinearities f and g. Note that for the case of local scalar equations such results are provided
by Nedev in [35] for n = 3 and Cabr´e in [5] for n = 4. For the case of scalar equation with the fractional
Laplacian operator, Ros-Oton and Serra in [36] established regularity results for dimensions n < 4s when
0 < s < 1. For the case of local gradient systems, that is when s = 1, such a regularity result is established
by the author and Cowan in [14] in dimensions n ≤3.
Proof of Theorem 1.2.
We suppose that (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ and (u, v) is the associated extremal solution of
(G)λ∗,γ∗. Set σ = γ∗
λ∗. From Lemma 4.7, we conclude that f ′(u)g′(v) ∈L2(Ω). Note that this and the
convexity of g show that
(5.7)
Z
Ω
f ′(u)2g(v)2
(v + 1)2
≤C.
Note that (−∆)su ∈L1 and (−∆)sv ∈L1 and hence we have u, v ∈Lp for any p <
n
n−2s. We now use the
domain decomposition method as in [14, 35]. Set

Similarly we have

We shall consider the case of n > 2s, and n ≤2s is straightforward as discussed in Section 2. Taking
α = 4(n−2s)
3n−4s
and using the Lp-bound on v for p <
n
n−2s shows that f ′(u)g(v) ∈Lp(Ω) for p <
2n
3n−4s. By
a symmetry argument we also have f(u)g′(v) ∈Lp(Ω) for p <
2n
3n−4s. Therefore, (−∆)su, (−∆)sv ∈Lp(Ω)
when p <
2n
3n−4s. From elliptic estimates we conclude that u, v ∈Lp(Ω) when p <
2n
3n−8s for n > 8
3s and
when p < ∞for n = 8
3s and when p ≤∞for n < 8
3s. This completes the proof when 2s ≤n < 8
3s.
Now, set α =
3n−8s
2(n−2s).
From the above estimate u, v ∈Lp(Ω) when p <
2n
3n−8s for n >
8
3s on v
and domain decomposition arguments, we get f(u)g′(v), f ′(u)g(v) ∈Lp(Ω) for p <
n
2(n−2s).
Therefore,
(−∆)su, (−∆)sv ∈Lp(Ω) with the latter bounds for p. From elliptic estimates we get u, v ∈Lp(Ω) when
p <
n
2(n−3s) for n > 3s and when p < ∞for n = 3s and when p ≤∞for n < 3s. We perform the above
arguments once more to arrive at u, v ∈Lp(Ω) when p <
2n
5n−16s for n > 16
5 s and when p < ∞for n = 16
5 s
and when p ≤∞for n < 16
5 s. This completes the proof for 8
3s ≤n < 16
5 s containing n = 3s.
Now, suppose that u, v ∈Lp(Ω) for p < p∗. Then, notice that
Z
Ω2
(f ′(u)g(v))p ≤
Z
Ω
(v + 1)
2p
α ≤C when p < αp∗
2 .
Set α =

p∗+2.
Then, from the above we conclude that f ′(u)g(v) ∈Lp(Ω) for p <
2p∗
p∗+2 and similarly
f(u)g′(v) ∈Lp(Ω) for p <
2p∗
p∗+2. Applying the fact that (−∆)su, (−∆)sv ∈Lp(Ω) for the same range of p.
From elliptic estimates we conclude that
u, v ∈Lp(Ω) when p <
2p∗n
p∗(n −4s) + 2n.
Applying the above elliptic estimates arguments, we conclude the boundedness of solutions when n < 4s.
✷

We end this section with power polynomial nonlinearities for the gradient system (H)λ∗,γ∗and we provide
regularity of the extremal solution. For the case of local systems, that is when s = 1, a similar result is given
in [14]. Due to the technicality of the proof we omit it here.
Theorem 5.1. Let f(u) = (1 + u)p and g(v) = (1 + v)q when p, q > 2. Assume that (λ∗, γ∗) ∈Υ. Then,
the associated extremal solution of (H)λ∗,γ∗is bounded provided
