Abstract: Liquid water has been proved to be an excellent medium for specimen structure imaging 
by a scanning electron microscope. Knowledge of electron-water interaction physics and 
particularly the secondary electron yield is essential to the interpretation of the imaging contrast. 
However, very little is known up to now experimentally on the low energy electron interaction 
with liquid water because of certain practical limitations. It is then important to gain some useful 
information about electron emission from water by a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique that 
can numerically model electron transport trajectories in water. In this study, we have performed 
MC simulations of electron emission from liquid water in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 
keV by using two different codes, i.e. a classical MC (CMC) code developed in our laboratory and 
the Geant4-DNA (G4DNA) code. The calculated secondary electron yield and electron 
backscattering coefficient are compared with experimental results wherever applicable to verify 
the validity of physical models for the electron-water interaction. The secondary electron yield vs. 
primary energy curves calculated by the two codes present the same generic curve shape as that of 
 
2 
 
metals but in rather different absolute values. G4DNA yields the underestimated absolute values 
due to the application of one step thermalization model by setting a cutoff energy at 7.4 eV so that 
the low energy losses due to phonon excitations are omitted. Our CMC calculation of secondary 
electron yield is closer to the experimental data and the energy distribution is reasonable. It is 
concluded that a full dielectric function data at low energy loss values below 7.4 eV shall be 
employed in G4DNA model for the modeling of low energy electrons.

I. 
Introduction 
Water, ubiquitous liquid in nature and as an essential life material is involved in radiation 
interactions in the fields of biophysics, environmental radiation protection, radiation dosimetry, 
space radiation physics etc. Moreover, it is also concerned with scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) imaging of biomaterials [1-3]. But due to difficulties to perform scattering experiments 
with liquid water in vacuum, there has been only a very limited amount of experimental work 
performed on electron-water (liquid state) interactions. With development of technology it is now 
possible to perform such an experiment with an environmental SEM [2-3]. However, the 
measurement with these techniques has been limited to high energy electrons (> 5 keV), and 
experiments with low energy electrons are still quite restricted. 
On the other hand, Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulation methods have extensively been applied 
in many fields to explore the electron-matter interaction mechanisms [4-5] and can therefore, 
provide a useful means to quench the increased thirst for the interaction mechanisms and for 
obtaining the required quantitative data. By a MC simulation technique, one calculates statistically 
moving electron trajectories in a sample which are formed by successive scattering events for 
incident electrons and signal electrons. The most important issue for an accurate MC simulation is 
the physical modeling of electron elastic and inelastic scattering in a medium. There are many 
different approaches available now for calculating elastic and inelastic scattering cross-sections 
under different approximations, and hence many corresponding MC codes have been developed 
based on these approaches. In our previous studies we have developed a MC simulation model 
based on a dielectric functional theory to treat electron inelastic scattering in a conductive solid 
[6-7]; this model has been successfully applied to the study of surface electron spectroscopic and 
SEM signals [8-12]. Besides there are also several other MC models and codes aimed mainly at 
study of electron interaction with conductive solids [13], and some MC codes have been developed 
to model electron-water interactions [14-19] and among them Geant4-DNA (G4DNA) [17-18] has 
received more attention. 
In this work we therefore aim to study secondary electron emission and electron backscattering 
from water by using two MC simulation models and codes, i.e. our CMC (classical trajectory MC) 
code and G4DNA code. The simulation results on secondary electron yield (SEY) and electron 
 
4 
 
backscattering coefficient in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 keV are compared with the 
available experimental data to validate the MC simulation modeling. 
II. CMC Physical Modeling 
While most of the present MC simulations are based on the classical trajectory concept of electron 
motion by random sampling of moving path and scattering fate, the present CMC physical 
modeling employ quantum mechanical formulations for electron elastic and inelastic scattering 
cross-sections. The effectiveness of the model for the simulation of cascade secondary electron 
generation in conductive solids has been conﬁrmed by comparing the simulated energy spectra 
and the SEYs with the experimental data [7-9]. This direct MC simulation of cascade production 
and emission of secondary electrons can provide quantitative physical quantities about secondary 
electrons without need of any fitting parameters and hence an illuminating insight into secondary 
electron emission phenomenon. In this work, we directly extend the calculation model from the 
conductive solid to liquid water. Although an improved simulation model is demonstrated to be 
quite useful for investigation of charging phenomenon in an insulating solid [20], the charging 
effect is negligible for liquid water. 
1. Electron Elastic Scattering 
At low energy region elastic scattering is the main interaction process for electrons. But there lacks 
experimental data for electron elastic scattering in liquid water at low energies. For the description 
of electron elastic scattering with an atomic-nuclei, which is responsible for the change of direction 
of electron velocity vector, the relativistic quantum mechanical formulation via Mott’s differential 
cross-section [21] has been employed:

 are the

the static-ﬁeld approximation with Dirac-Fock atomic electron densities [23] and Fermi-
distribution nuclear densities. The Furness-McCarthy exchange potential [24] is added to account 
for exchange effects while polarization and absorption are ignored. The calculation of Mott cross-
section has been performed by using the computer code ELSEPA [25]. The same scattering 
potential was used to simulate reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra of metals [26]. 
This scattering potential is considered to be much more accurate than other potential, such as 
Thomas-Fermi-Dirac atomic potential. It is well known that the Mott cross-section exceeds the 
Rutherford formula based on classical mechanics at low electron energies and particularly for 
heavy elements due to spin-orbit coupling during electron collision with the nuclei [27]. For the 
calculation to liquid water, only the molecular density and chemical composition of H2O have been 
considered in deriving molecular scattering cross-section from individual atomic components by 
ignoring the molecular structure. 
2. Electron Inelastic Scattering 
For modeling electron inelastic scattering in a dielectric medium, the Penn’s formalism based on 
a dielectric functional approach has been employed. The differential inverse electron inelastic 
mean free path (DIIMFP) for an electron with kinetic energy E  in the first Born approximation is 
given by

Hence, by the full Penn’s algorithm the low energy secondary electron generation from Fermi sea 
has two distinct mechanisms, either through single electron excitation or via a plasmon decay 
[12,29]. By the property of the Lindhard ELF, the single electron excitation occurs if

Once the ELF is determined, the energy loss distribution and the electron IMFP,

 is due to the Pauli exclusion principle that an electron cannot fall into 
the Fermi sea which is already occupied by electrons. The energy loss distribution is used for 
sampling a specific energy loss value in an inelastic scattering event, while IMFP with total elastic 
scattering cross-section determines the transport mean free path used for sampling a flight step 
length in a MC simulation. 
As for optical data, experimental optical constants are used to derive the complex dielectric 
constant, 

 as input to the simulation. Use 
of experimental data allows an accurate description of phonon excitation and electronic excitation 
processes responsible for electron energy loss in a realistic material. Fig. 1 shows the experimental 
data of optical ELF for liquid water as a function of energy loss [31-33]. There is no obvious 
difference on ELF between liquid, hexagonal ice and amorphous ice, but liquid phase differs 
largely with gas phase in the mid-energy loss range of 10-80 eV. The energy loss and the rate due 
to the excitation of rotational and translational phonon modes are much lower than the electronic 
excitation considered here for secondary electron generation [34]; the energy loss due to phonon 
excitation below 1 eV cannot contribute to emitted secondary electron signals but plays an 
important role to slow down electrons including the cascade secondary electrons inside water. ELF 
indicates that the dominant contribution to the energy loss and the associated secondary electron 
generation is the electronic excitation around several tens eV, which is mostly associated 
molecular orbitals of water and does not have obvious characteristic excitation edges. An obvious 
sharp ionization edge around 
532
B
E 
 eV is due to K-electrons of oxygen atoms, which plays an 
important role to the electron stopping power. 
3. Secondary Electron Generation 
 
8 
 
According to this full Penn algorithm there is no difference on the treatment of energy loss in an 
inelastic scattering event due to valence electron excitation and the inner shell ionization, but 
production of secondary electron by these two distinct loss mechanisms differs. Here only the K 
shell of oxygen is considered as an inner shell. In an inelastic scattering event an energy loss 
 
 
is firstly sampled with a uniform random number from Eq. (8). If 
 
B
E

, then a secondary 
electron is assumed to be excited from the Fermi sea by transferring 
 
 from the moving electron 
to a valence electron of energy with the excitation probability being proportional to a joint density 
of states of free electrons 


 is the energy of the valence electron. For 
the mechanism of secondary electron generation via bulk plasmon decay [35], we assumed that 
the energy loss for bulk plasmon excitation is then immediately transferred to a secondary electron. 
An excited secondary electron may undergo the similar electron inelastic scattering to produce 
multiple lower energy secondary electrons and cause a cascade production. For secondary electron 
penetration from the surface barrier into vacuum to become emitted signals, a quantum description 
of the transmission probability is adopted [7]. The transmission function can be written as:

By using this direct MC simulation of secondary electron production, the SEY value, , can be 
evaluated by taking the ratio of the number of emitted true secondary electrons (

number of simulated incident electrons at a given primary beam energy 
p
E . 
III. G4DNA Physical Modeling 
G4DNA is the low energy extension of Geant4 [14-16, 19], which is an open source MC simulation 
toolkit based on object orientated programming rules, coded with the C++ language, created and 
developed at CERN. Liquid water has been chosen as an interacting medium for the application of 
G4DNA for its importance to radiobiological simulations. McNamara et al. have used Geant4 to 
investigate the low energy secondary electron track structures produced by x-ray and proton beams 
 
9 
 
in liquid water [36]. G4DNA employs physics models for electron interaction processes by 
including elastic scattering, electronic excitation and ionization in the kinetic energy range of 7.4 
eV- 1 MeV [17-18, 37-46]. Like CMC all interactions are treated as discrete processes, i.e. an 
electron does not lose its kinetic energy along the flight step length and interaction happens always 
at the flight step terminal. A moving electron can produce a secondary electron once the energy 
loss in an inelastic scattering is higher than the binding energy of the target electron. 
1. Electron Elastic Scattering 
In G4DNA, elastic scattering cross-sections are computed either by a screened Rutherford model 
or by a partial wave model. Screened Rutherford model has the advantage that differential and 
total elastic scattering cross-sections are analytic, which is considered most suitable for fast MC 
simulations [43-44]. Here we used the improved screened Rutherford model implemented in 
G4DNA which has a better agreement with the more elaborate partial wave model. 
The approach applied in Geant4 consists of extending the following elastic scattering models for 
the free atoms (and molecules) to the liquid phase. For electron energies above 200 eV, the 
screened Rutherford differential scattering cross-section is adopted [40,44]:

2. Electron Inelastic Scattering 
To calculate electron inelastic scattering cross-section a dielectric formulation is used with a 
correction at low energy. The calculation of ionization and excitation cross-sections [37-44] for 
incident electron with energy <10 keV is based on the Emfietzoglou semi-empirical inelastic 
model [42,45] of the dielectric function with Heller’s optical data [48]. It makes use of (a) the 
dielectric formalism for the valence shells responsible for condensed-phase effects and (b) the 
binary-encounter-approximation for the K-shell of oxygen atoms. According to this model, the 
electronic structure of liquid water can be represented by four “outer” ionization shells, one “inner” 
ionization shell (the K-shell of oxygen), and five discrete excitation levels.

At low energies, the exchange and correlation effects play an important role; therefore, for electron 
energies <1 keV, the Born approximation formula is corrected by using classic Coulomb-field 
correction and the exchange correction terms [49] according to ICRU report [50]. Coulomb-field 
correction accounts for the potential energy gained by the incident electron in the field of the target 
molecule. The Coulomb corrected differential cross-section

. In G4DNA the inelastic scattering 
cross-sections are applicable down to 7.4 eV (the minimum electronic excitation potential of water 
 
14 
 
molecule) [40-41]. Like other track structure codes (NOREC, PARTRAC etc.), in G4DNA an 
electron is stopped when its energy is lowered down to this cutoff energy of 7.4 eV, and is 
considered as solvated or thermalized while its remaining energy is assumed to be locally 
deposited. This was considered as adequate for energy deposition studies [40-41]. Also, Eq. (18) 
allows non-zero values for

 for all positive values of , i.e. even at sub-ionization 
and sub-excitation energies, which is clearly unphysical. A common strategy to overcome this 
problem, also adopted in the G4DNA existing model, is to “cut” the Drude functions at 
n
B  so that 
they vanish below the ionization thresholds [43-44]. 
Below the threshold energy electron attachment and dissociation reactions become important [40-
41,52-53]. In G4DNA, dissociative electron attachment cross-sections are available at energies 4-
13 eV and vibrational excitation cross-section data set is available for energy range 2-100 eV [54-
55]. 
IV. Simulation with G4DNA 
For simulation with G4DNA, we used Geant4 ver.10.4 on Ubuntu environment for the simulation 
of SEY and electron backscattering coefficient for liquid water. All materials were defined 
according to their composition stated in the NIST materials database (built into Geant4). The 
accuracy of the geometry was veriﬁed by activating G4PVPlacement constructor to check for any 
overlapping volumes. The number of primary electrons used was 106 which were incident 
orthogonal to the target plane. We designed our simulation in such a manner that we can use 
different G4DNA physics options; however, we constructed our own physics list so that we can 
use modified Emfietzoglou model for inelastic scattering with Uehara screened Rutherford elastic 
scattering model. 
V. Results and Discussion 
1. Secondary Electron Yield 
The SEY was calculated as the ratio of the number of emitted secondary electrons with energies 
less than 50 eV to the number of primary electrons; the number of 106 incident electrons are used 
at each condition). Fig. 2 shows a comparison on the SEY vs. primary energy curve, 

p
E

, 
between the simulation results from the two codes and the experimental results [56-58]. The 
 
15 
 
experimental data shows very large deviations particularly below 1 keV where only two dada sets 
are avilable; the deviation may be attributred to different experimental procedures adopted as well 
as to the physical forms of water used for experiments. For example, Hilleret used monolayers of 
amorphous solid water on Cu substrate [58], Suszcynsky measured SEY for water ice [57], 
whereas Thiel measured liquid water [56]. It can be seen that the two codes, CMC and G4DNA, 
give the very similar SEY curve shape; however, there is a significant difference in the absolute 
SEY values calculated from the two codes. The SEY calculated from G4DNA model is much 
lower as compared to that calculated from CMC. It can be seen that the simulation results with our 
CMC code are much closer to the experimental results of Hilleret et al. below 1 keV, and to all 
three experimental data sets above 1 keV. 
In order to identify the origin of the lower SEY values from G4DNA we illustrate in Fig. 3 the 
normalized energy spectra of secondary electrons calculated by the two codes. Our CMC 
simulation presents a universal distribution curve shape as that of metals [29], which peaks at 1.5 
eV above vacuum level and having FWHM~4.8 eV. But G4DNA yields an abnormal curve shape 
which is abruptly cutoff at 7.4 eV and, hence, there is no usual low energy secondary electron 
signals below 7.4 eV. This behavior is obviously attributed to the fact that in G4DNA electrons 
with energies lower than 7.4 eV by default are not tracked; when an electron reaches the highest 
energy domain of G4DNA one step thermalization model (7.4 eV), it is then automatically 
converted into a solvated electron and displaced from its original position. The fundamental reason 
of setting such a minimum electronic excitation potential for water molecule is due to the Heller’s 
optical dielectric function data [48] employed in the semi-empirical inelastic model [42,45] of the 
dielectric function, where the ELF is vanishing for 
7.4

 eV and, hence, the inelastic scattering 
cross-section becomes zero when electron energy is below 7.4 eV. To verify this, we have further 
reduced the upper limit of thermalization model by setting the smaller cutoff energies as 5-2 eV to 
enable electron transport at lower energy region above the threshold value and then calculated the 
SEY by G4DNA. Fig. 4 shows the calculated secondary electron energy spectra for different 
thresholds. As predicated the energy distribution cutoff is lowered down correspondingly and the 
increased area under the curve contributes to increased SEY values. Fig. 5 shows that as we reduce 
the upper limit of the thermalization model the SEY increases. However, when we compare with 
the inset of Fig. 2 it is clearly that the absolute SEY values by G4DNA still differ largely with 
experimental data of Hilleret [58] except by setting threshold around 4 eV, let along the energy 
 
16 
 
distribution curve in Fig. 4. Table 1 shows a comparison on the maximum SEY value, 
max

, and 
the corresponding maximum energy, 
max
E
, obtained from the two MC codes with that of 
experimental data. The maximum energy is the primary energy at which the SEY reaches the 
maximum. From the table, we can observe that there is a general agreement in values of 
max
E
 
between experiment [58], CMC and G4DNA; but for 
max

 still there is a certain difference. 
As explained the threshold of 7.4 eV is due to the use of Heller’s optical dielectric function data 
[48]. In our CMC simulation the optical data are taken from Segelstein [31] where the ELF is 
vanishing between 1-6 eV but is significant below 0.45 eV as can be seen in Fig. 1, therefore the 
low energy electrons (
7
E 
 eV) still have large inelastic scattering cross-section for energy loss 
due to vibrational excitation processes to slow down electrons. In this way the CMC code does not 
impose any cutoff on electron energy and can simulate complete secondary electron energy 
spectrum in the full range of 0-50 eV. 
2. Electron backscattering coefficient 
Electron backscattering coeﬃcient, 
,
 has also been calculated as the ratio of the number of 
backscattered electrons with energies greater than 50 eV to the number incident electrons. Fig. 6 
compares the two codes for the values of  in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 keV. The 
results show good agreement on the 


p
E

 curve with a negligible difference on vales. 
Unfortunately, there is no sufficient experimental data for verification; the only available 
experimental data set is that of Joy [3] measured at high energies of 15-30 keV for liquid water 
using QuantomixTM capsules. 
VI. Conclusions 
In conclusion, we have compared our CMC code with G4DNA code for the calculation of SEY 
and electron backscattering coefficient for liquid water in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 
keV. For electron backscattering coefficient the two codes agree with each other quite well. For 
the SEY, both CMC and G4DNA calculations yield the same curve shape of SEY dependence on 
primary energy but the absolute values are quite different. G4DNA underestimates the SEY values 
when compared with several experimental data sets. In addition, the energy distribution of 
 
17 
 
secondary electrons calculated by G4DNA is abnormal, showing an abrupt cut off at 7.4 eV. This 
is due to the use of Heller’s optical dielectric function data in the G4DNA inelastic model where 
the ELF is vanishing for 
7.4

 eV. Therefore, a full optical data by covering the low energy 
loss range (
7
1.24 10

- 5.9 eV of Segelstein) shold be used in G4DNA model.
