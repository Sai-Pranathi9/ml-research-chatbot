On some properties of weak solutions
to elliptic equations with divergence-free drifts
Nikolay Filonov and Timofey Shilkin
Abstract. We discuss the local properties of weak solutions to the equation
−∆u + b· ∇u = 0. The corresponding theory is well-known in the case b ∈Ln,
where n is the dimension of the space. Our main interest is focused on the
case b ∈L2. In this case the structure assumption div b = 0 turns out to be
crucial.
1. Introduction and Notation
Assume n ≥2, Ω⊂Rn is a smooth bounded domain, b : Ω→Rn, f : Ω→R.
In this paper we investigate the properties of weak solutions u : Ω→R to the
following scalar equation
(1.1)
−∆u + b · ∇u = f
in
Ω.
This equation describes the diﬀusion in a stationary incompressible ﬂow. If it is
not stated otherwise, we always impose the following conditions
b ∈L2(Ω),
f ∈W −1
2
(Ω)
(see the list of notation at the end of this section). We use the following
Definition 1.1. Assume b ∈L2(Ω), f ∈W −1
2
(Ω). The function u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) is
called a weak solution to the equation (1.1) if the following integral identity holds:
(1.2)
Z
Ω
∇u · (∇η + bη) dx = ⟨f, η⟩,
∀η ∈C∞
0 (Ω).
Together with the equation (1.1) one can consider the formally conjugate (up
to the sign of the drift) equation
(1.3)
−∆u + div(bu) = f
in
Ω.

Definition 1.2. Assume b ∈L2(Ω), f ∈W −1
2
(Ω). The function u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) is
called a weak solution to the equation (1.3) if
(1.4)
Z
Ω
(∇u −bu) · ∇η dx = ⟨f, η⟩,
∀η ∈C∞
0 (Ω).
The advantage of the equation (1.3) is that it allows one to deﬁne weak solutions
for a drift b belonging to a weaker class than L2(Ω). Namely, Deﬁnition 1.2 makes
sense for u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) if
(1.5)
b ∈Ls(Ω)
where
s =

2n
n+2,
n ≥3,
1 + ε, ε > 0,
n = 2.
Nevertheless, it is clear that for a divergence-free drift b ∈L2(Ω) the Deﬁnitions
1.1 and 1.2 coincide.
Together with the equation (1.1) we discuss boundary value problems with
Dirichlet boundary conditions:
(1.6)
(
−∆u + b · ∇u = f
in
Ω,
u|∂Ω= ϕ.
For weak solutions the boundary condition is understood in the sense of traces.
Assume f is “good enough” and b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0. Our main observation is that
the regularity of solution u inside Ωcan depend on the behaviour of its boundary
values.
If the function ϕ is bounded, then the solution u is also bounded (see
Theorem 3.4 below). If the function ϕ is unbounded on ∂Ω, then the solution u can
become inﬁnite in internal points of Ω(see Example 3.6 below). So, we distinguish
between two cases: the case of general boundary data ϕ ∈W 1/2
2
(∂Ω), and the case
of bounded boundary data
(1.7)
ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω) ∩W 1/2
2
(∂Ω).
Discussing the properties of weak solutions to the problem (1.6) we also distinguish
between another two cases: in Section 2 we consider suﬃciently regular drifts,
namely, b ∈Ln(Ω), and in Section 3 we focus on the case of drifts b from L2(Ω)
satisfying div b = 0. Section 4 is devoted to possible ways of relaxation of the condi-
tion b ∈Ln(Ω) in the framework of the regularity theory. In Appendix for reader’s
convenience some proofs (most of which are either known or straightforward) are
gathered.
Together with the elliptic equation (1.1) it is possible to consider its parabolic
analogue
(1.8)
∂tu −∆u + b · ∇u = f
in
Ω× (0, T ),
but it should be a subject of a separate survey. We address the interested readers
to the related papers [Z], [LZ], [NU], [Sem], [SSSZ], [SV], [SVZ] and references
there.
In the paper we explore the following notation. For any a, b ∈Rn we denote by
a · b its scalar product in Rn. We denote by Lp(Ω) and W k
p (Ω) the usual Lebesgue
and Sobolev spaces. The space
◦
W 1
p(Ω) is the closure of C∞
0 (Ω) in W 1
p (Ω) norm.
The negative Sobolev space W −1
p
(Ω), p ∈(1, +∞), is the set of all distributions
which are bounded functionals on
◦
W 1
p′(Ω) with p′ :=
p
p−1. For any f ∈W −1
p
(Ω)

and w ∈
◦
W 1
p′(Ω) we denote by ⟨f, w⟩the value of the distribution f on the function
w. We use the notation W 1/2
2
(∂Ω) for the Slobodetskii–Sobolev space. By C(¯Ω)
and Cα(¯Ω), α ∈(0, 1) we denote the spaces of continuous and H¨older continuous
functions on ¯Ω. The space C1+α(¯Ω) consists of functions u whose gradient ∇u is
H¨older continuous. The index “loc” in notation of the functional spaces L∞,loc(Ω),
Cα
loc(Ω), C1+α
loc (Ω) etc implies that the function belongs to the corresponding func-
tional class over every compact set which is contained in Ω. The symbols ⇀and
→stand for the weak and strong convergence respectively. We denote by BR(x0)
the ball in Rn of radius R centered at x0 and write BR if x0 = 0. We write also B
instead of B1.
2. Regular drifts
2.1. Local properties. For suﬃciently regular drifts we have the local H¨older
continuity of a solution.
Theorem 2.1. Assume
(2.1)
b ∈Ln(Ω)
if
n ≥3,
Z
Ω
|b|2 ln(2 + |b|2) dx < ∞
if
n = 2.
Let u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) be a weak solution to (1.1) with f satisfying
f ∈Lp(Ω),
p > n
2 .
Then
u ∈Cα
loc(Ω)
with

α = 2 −n
p ,
p < n,
∀α < 1,
p ≥n.
The local H¨older continuity of weak solutions in Theorem 2.1 with some α ∈
(0, 1) is well-known, see [St, Theorem 7.1] or [NU, Corollary 2.3] in the case f ≡0.
The H¨older continuity with arbitrary α ∈(0, 1) was proved in the case f ≡0, for
example, in [F]. The extension of this result for non-zero right hand side is routine.
If b possesses more integrability then the ﬁrst gradient of a weak solution is
locally H¨older continuous.
Theorem 2.2. Let b ∈Lp(Ω) with p > n, and u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) be a weak solution
to (1.1) with f ∈Lp(Ω). Then u ∈C1+α
loc (Ω) with α = 1 −n
p .
For the proof see [LU, Chapter III, Theorem 15.1].
2.2. Boundary value problem. We consider the second term
R
Ω
∇u · b η dx
in the equation (1.2) as a bilinear form in
◦
W 1
2(Ω).
It deﬁnes a linear operator
T :
◦
W 1
2(Ω) →
◦
W 1
2(Ω) by the relation
(2.2)
Z
Ω
∇(T u) · ∇η dx =
Z
Ω
∇u · b η dx,
∀u, η ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω).
The following result is well-known.
Theorem 2.3. Let b satisfy (2.1). Then the operator T :
◦
W 1
2(Ω) →
◦
W 1
2(Ω)
deﬁned by (2.2) is compact.

Indeed, if n ≥3 then the estimate
(2.3)

Ω
∇u · b η dx

≤Cb∥∇u∥L2(Ω)∥∇η∥L2(Ω)
∀u, η ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω)
follows by the imbedding theorem and the H¨older inequality. In the case n = 2 such
estimate can be found for example in [F, Lemma 4.3]. Next, the operator T can be
approximated in the operator norm by compact linear operators Tε generated by
the bilinear forms
R
Ω
∇u · bε η dx where bε ∈C∞(¯Ω).
Remark 2.4. The condition b ∈L2(Ω) in the case n = 2 is not suﬃcient. For
example, one can take Ω= B1/3,
b(x) =
x
|x|2 |ln |x||3/4 ,
u(x) = η(x) = |ln |x||3/8 −(ln 3)3/8.
Then
R
Ω
∇u·b η dx = ∞, and therefore, the corresponding operator T is unbounded.
Remark 2.5. The issue of boundedness and compactness of the operator T in
the case of the whole space, Ω= Rn, is investigated in full generality in [MV], see
Theorem 4.1 below. In this section we restrict ourselves by considering assumptions
on b only in Lp–scale.
Now, the problem (1.6) with ϕ ≡0 reduces to the equation u + T u = h in
◦
W 1
2(Ω) with an appropriate right hand side h. The solvability of the last equation
follows from the Fredholm theory. Roughly speaking, “the existence follows from
the uniqueness”.
The uniqueness in the case b ∈Ln(Ω), n ≥3, and div b = 0 is especially simple.
In this situation
Z
Ω
b · ∇u u dx = 0
∀u ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω),
and the uniqueness for the problem (1.6) follows.
In the general case of drifts
satisfying (2.1) without the condition div b = 0 the proof of the uniqueness is more
sophisticated. It requires the maximum principle which can be found, for example,
in [NU], see Corollary 2.2 and remarks at the end of Section 2 there.
Theorem 2.6. Let b satisfy (2.1). Assume u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) is a weak solution to
the problem (1.6) with f ≡0 and ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω) ∩W 1/2
2
(∂Ω). Then either u ≡const
in Ωor the following estimate holds:
essinf∂Ωϕ < u(x) < esssup∂Ωϕ,
∀x ∈Ω.
Corollary 2.7. Let b satisfy (2.1). Then a weak solution to the problem (1.6)
is unique in the space W 1
2 (Ω).
Now, the solvability of the problem (1.6) is straightforward.
Theorem 2.8. Let b satisfy (2.1).
Then for any f ∈W −1
2
(Ω) and ϕ ∈
W 1/2
2
(∂Ω) the problem (1.6) has the unique weak solution u ∈W 1
2 (Ω), and

Proof. For ϕ ≡0 Theorem 2.8 follows from Fredholm’s theory. In the general
case the problem (1.6) can be reduced to the corresponding problem with homoge-
neous boundary conditions for the function v := u −˜ϕ, where ˜ϕ is some extension
of ϕ from ∂Ωto Ωwith the control of the norm ∥˜ϕ∥W 1
2 (Ω) ≤c∥ϕ∥W 1/2
2
(∂Ω). The
function v can be determined as a weak solution to the problem
(2.4)
(
−∆v + b · ∇v = f + ∆˜ϕ −b · ∇˜ϕ
in
Ω,
v|∂Ω= 0
Under assumption (2.1) the right hand side belongs to W −1
2
(Ω) due to Theorem
2.3.
□
Note that for n ≥3 the problems (1.6) and (2.4) are equivalent only in the
case of “regular” drifts b ∈Ln(Ω). If b ∈L2(Ω) and additionally div b = 0, then
b·∇˜ϕ ∈W −1
n′ (Ω), n′ =
n
n−1, and the straightforward reduction of the problem (1.6)
to the problem with homogeneous boundary data is not possible.
Finally, to investigate in Section 3 the problem (1.6) with divergence-free drifts
from L2(Ω) we need the following maximum estimate.
Theorem 2.9. Let b satisfy (2.1). Assume ϕ satisﬁes (1.7) and let u ∈W 1
2 (Ω)
be a weak solution to (1.6) with some f ∈Lp(Ω), p > n/2. Then
1) u ∈L∞(Ω) and
(2.5)
∥u∥L∞(Ω) ≤∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω) + C ∥f∥Lp(Ω).
2) If div b = 0 then C = C(n, p, Ω) does not depend on b.
We believe Theorem 2.9 is known though it is diﬃcult for us to identify the
precise reference to the statement we need. So, we present its proof in Appendix.
Remark 2.10. For n ≥3 consider the following example:
Ω= B,
u(x) = ln |x|,
b(x) = (n −2) x
|x|2 .
The statements of Theorem 2.1, Theorem 2.6 and Corollary 2.7 are violated for
these functions. On the other hand, −∆u + b · ∇u = 0, u ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω) and b ∈Lp(Ω)
for any p < n. It means that for non-divergence free drifts the condition b ∈Ln(Ω)
in (2.1) is sharp.
Remark 2.11. For n = 2 the condition b ∈L2(Ω) is not suﬃcient.
The
statements of Theorem 2.1, Theorem 2.6 and Corollary 2.7 are violated for the
functions
u(x) = ln |ln |x|| ,
b(x) = −
x
|x|2 ln |x|
in a ball Ω= B1/e, nevertheless b ∈L2(Ω).
Converesely, if in the case n = 2 we assume that b ∈L2(Ω) and div b = 0, then
the estimate (2.3) is fulﬁlled (see [MV] or [F]), and all statements of this section
(Theorems 2.1, 2.3, 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9) hold true, see [F] or [NU]. So, this case can
be considered as the regular one. See also Remark 4.3 below.

3. Non-regular divergence-free drifts
In this section we always assume that div b = 0. It turns out that this assump-
tion plays the crucial role in local boundedness of weak solutions if one considers
drifts b ∈Lp(Ω) with p < n, n ≥3. Recall that the case n = 2, b ∈L2(Ω) and
div b = 0 can be considered as a regular case, see Remark 2.11. Thus, below we
restrict ourselves to the case n ≥3.
3.1. Boundary value problem. We have the following approximation result.
Theorem 3.1. Assume b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, f ∈W −1
2
(Ω), and let u ∈W 1
2 (Ω)
be a weak solution to (1.1). Assume also bk ∈Ln(Ω), div bk = 0 is an arbitrary
sequence satisfying
bk →b
in
L2(Ω),
and let uk ∈W 1
2 (Ω) be the unique weak solution to the problem
(3.1)
(
−∆uk + bk · ∇uk = f,
uk|∂Ω= ϕ,
where ϕ = u|∂Ω. Then
(3.2)
uk →u
in
Lq(Ω)
for any
q <
n
n −2.
Moreover, if ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω) then
(3.3)
uk ⇀u
in
W 1
2 (Ω).
Finally, if ϕ ≡0 then the energy inequality holds:
(3.4)
Z
Ω
|∇u|2 dx ≤⟨f, u⟩.
The convergence (3.2) is proved (in its parabolic version) for q = 1 in [Z,
Proposition 2.4].
Note that the proof in [Z] uses the uniform Gaussian upper
bound of the Green functions of the operators ∂tu −∆u + bk · ∇u (sf. [A]). In
Appendix we present an elementary proof of Theorem 3.1 based on the maximum
estimate in Theorem 2.9 and duality arguments.
Theorem 3.1 has several consequences. The ﬁrst of them is the uniqueness of
weak solutions, see [Z] and [Zhi]:
Theorem 3.2. Let b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0. Then a weak solution to the problem
(1.6) is unique in the class W 1
2(Ω).
Indeed, u is a Lq-limit of the approximating sequence uk, and such limit is
unique. The alternative proof of the uniqueness (which is in a sense “direct”, i.e.
it does not hang upon the approximation result of Theorem 3.1) for b ∈L2(Ω),
div b = 0, can be found in [Zhi] (see also some development in [Su]). Note that
in [Zhi] it was also shown that the uniqueness can break for weak solutions to the
equation (1.3) if b satisfy (1.5) (actually a little better than (1.5)) and div b = 0,
but b /∈L2(Ω).
Another consequence of Theorem 3.1 is the existence of weak solution.
Theorem 3.3. Let b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0. Then for any f ∈W −1
2
(Ω) and any
ϕ satisfying (1.7) there exists a weak solution to the problem (1.6).
ON SOME PROPERTIES OF WEAK SOLUTIONS
7
Theorem 3.3 is proved in Appendix.
Finally, Theorem 3.1 allows one to establish the global boundedness of weak
solutions whenever the boundary data are bounded.
Theorem 3.4. Let b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, f ∈Lp(Ω), p > n/2, and ϕ satisﬁes
(1.7). Assume u ∈W 1
2(Ω) is a weak solution to (1.6). Then u ∈L∞(Ω) and
(3.5)
∥u∥L∞(Ω) ≤∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω) + C ∥f∥Lp(Ω),
where the constant C = C(n, p, Ω) is independent on b.
Theorem 3.4 is proved in Appendix.
3.2. Local properties. Note that any weak solution to (1.1) belonging to
the class W 1
2 (Ω) can be viewed as a weak solution to the problem (1.6) with some
ϕ ∈W 1/2
2
(Ω).
Theorem 3.5. Assume div b = 0 and
b ∈Lp(B)
where
p = 2
if
n = 3
and
p > n
2
if
n ≥4.
Let u ∈W 1
2 (B) be a weak solution to (1.1) in B with some f ∈Lq(B), q > n/2.
Then u ∈L∞(B1/2) and
∥u∥L∞(B1/2) ≤C

∥u∥W 1
2 (B) + ∥f∥Lq(B)

where the constant C depends only on n, p, q and ∥b∥Lp(B).
Theorem 3.5 was proved (in the parabolic version) in [Z].
For the reader’s
convenience we present the proof of this theorem in Appendix.
Let us consider the following
Example 3.6. Assume n ≥4 and put
u(x) = ln r,
b = (n −3)
 1
r er −(n −3) z
r2 ez

,
where r2 = x2
1 + ... + x2
n−1, z = xn, and er, ez are the basis vectors of the corre-
sponding cylindrical coordinate system in Rn. Then u ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω), and
−∆u + b · ∇u = 0.
Next, div b = 0, b(x) = O(r−2) near the axis of symmetry, and hence
b ∈Lp(B)
for any
p < n −1
2
.
Clearly, the assumption b ∈L2(Ω) leads to the restriction n ≥6.
So, for
divergence-free drifts b ∈L2(Ω) we have the following picture. Assume u ∈W 1
2 (Ω)
is a weak solution to (1.6) with f ∈Lp(Ω), p > n/2. Theorem 3.4 means that
ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω) ∩W 1/2
2
(∂Ω)
=⇒
u ∈L∞(Ω)
for any n ≥2.
The Example 3.6 shows that for general ϕ we have
ϕ ∈W 1/2
2
(∂Ω)
=⇒



if n ≤3 then u ∈L∞,loc(Ω),
if n ≥6 then it is possible u ̸∈L∞,loc(Ω),
if n = 4, 5 – open questions.
Theorem 3.4 and Example 3.6 together establish an interesting phenomena:
for drifts b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, the property of the elliptic operator in (1.1) to
8
NIKOLAY FILONOV AND TIMOFEY SHILKIN
improve the “regularity” of weak solutions (in the sense that every weak solution
is locally bounded) depends on the behavior of a weak solution on the boundary
of the domain. If the values of ϕ := u|∂Ωon the boundary are bounded then this
weak solution must be bounded as Theorem 3.4 says. On the other hand, if the
function ϕ is unbounded on ∂Ωthen the weak solution can be unbounded even
near internal points of the domain Ωas Example 3.6 shows. To our opinion such a
behavior of solutions to an elliptic equation is unexpected. Allowing some abuse of
language we can say that non-regularity of the drift can destroy the hypoellipticity
of the operator.
Theorem 3.4 impose some restrictions on the structure of the set of singular
points of weak solutions. Namely, let us deﬁne a singular point of a weak solution
as a point for which the weak solution is unbounded in any its neighborhood, and
then deﬁne the singular set of a weak solution as the set of all its singular points.
It is clear that the singular set is closed. Theorem 3.4 shows that if for some weak
solution its singular set is non-empty then its 1-dimensional Hausdorﬀmeasure
must be positive.
Theorem 3.7. Let b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, and let u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) be a weak solution
to (1.1) with f ∈Lp(Ω), p > n/2. Denote by Σ ⊂¯Ωthe singular set of u and
assume Σ ∩Ω̸= ∅. Then any point of the set Σ ∩Ωnever can be surrounded by
any smooth closed (n −1)-dimensional surface S ⊂¯Ωsuch that u|S ∈L∞(S). In
particular, this means that
(3.6)
H1(Σ) > 0,
Σ ∩∂Ω̸= ∅,
where H1 is one-dimensional Hausdorﬀmeasure in Rn.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is clear. Let us prove (3.6). Assume Σ ∩Ω̸= ∅
and x0 ∈Σ ∩Ω. Denote d := dist{x0, ∂Ω}. Let z0 ∈∂Ωbe a point such that
|z0 −x0| = d and denote by [x0, z0] the straight line segment connecting x0 with z0.
Let us take arbitrary δ > 0 and consider any countable covering of Σ by open balls
{Bρi(yi)} such that ρi ≤δ. For any i denote ri := |x0 −yi|. If ri ≤d then denote
zi := [x0, z0] ∩∂Bri(x0). By Theorem 3.4 for any r ≤d we have Σ ∩∂Br(x0) ̸= ∅.
Therefore,
[x0, z0] ⊂
[
ri≤d
Bρi(zi).
This inclusion means that
H1(Σ) ≥H1 ([x0, z0]) = d > 0.
□
Theorem 3.7 in particular implies that no isolated singularity is possible. This
exactly what Example 3.6 demonstrates: the singular set in this case is the axis of
symmetry.
Note that the divergence free condition brings signiﬁcant improvements into
the local boundedness results. Without the condition div b = 0 one can prove local
boundedness of weak solutions to (1.1) only for b ∈Ln(Ω) (n ≥3), while if div b = 0
the local boundedness is valid for any b ∈Lp(Ω) with p > n
2 . Note also that for
the moment of writing of this paper we can say nothing about analogues of neither
Theorem 3.5 nor Example 3.6 if p ∈[ n−1
2 , n
2 ]. We state this problem as an open
question.
ON SOME PROPERTIES OF WEAK SOLUTIONS

The ﬁnal issue we need to discuss is the problem of further regularity of solutions
to the equation (1.1). The example of a bounded weak solution which is not locally
continuous was constructed originally in [SSSZ] for n = 3 and b ∈L1(Ω), div b = 0
(actually the method of [SSSZ] allowed to extend their example for b ∈Lp, p ∈
[1, 2)). Later the ﬁrst author in [F] generalized this example for all n ≥3 and for
all p ∈[1, n).
Theorem 3.8. Assume n ≥3, p < n. Then there exist b ∈Lp(B) satisfying
div b = 0 and a weak solution u to (1.1) with f ≡0 such that u ∈W 1
2 (B) ∩L∞(B)
but u ̸∈C( ¯B1/2).
The latter result shows that if one is interested in the local continuity of weak
solutions then the assumption b ∈Ln(Ω) can not be weakened in the Lebesgue
scale and the structure condition div b = 0 does not help in this situation.
It is not diﬃcult to construct also a weak solution to (1.1) which is continuous
but not H¨older continuous.
Example 3.9. Assume n ≥4 and take
u(x) =
1
ln r ,
b =
n −3
r
−
2
r ln r

er +
(n −3)2

r2 ln2 r

z ez.
Here r2 = x2
1 + ...+ x2
n−1, z = xn, and er, ez are the basis vectors of the cylindrical
coordinate system. Then u ∈W 1
2 (B1/2) ∩C(B1/2), −∆u + b · ∇u = 0, div b = 0 in
B1/2 and b ∈Lp(B1/2) for any p < n−1
2 .
Thus, for weak solutions of (1.1) with b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, in large space
dimensions (at least for n ≥6) the following sequence of implications can break at
any step:
u ∈W 1
2 (Ω)
̸=⇒
u ∈L∞,loc(Ω)
̸=⇒
u ∈Cloc(Ω)
̸=⇒
u ∈Cα
loc(Ω).
4. Beyond the Lp–scale
Theorem 3.8 shows that in order to obtain the local continuity of weak solutions
to (1.1) for drifts weaker than b ∈Ln(Ω) one needs to go beyond the Lebesgue scale.
We start with the question of the boundedness of the operator T deﬁned by
the formula (2.2). The necessary and suﬃcient condition on b is obtained in [MV]
in the case Ω= Rn.
Theorem 4.1. The inequality (2.3) holds true if and only if the drift b can be
represented as a sum b = b0 + b1, where the function b0 is such that
(4.1)
Z
Rn
|b0|2|η|2 dx ≤C
Z
Rn
|∇η|2 dx,
∀η ∈C∞
0 (Rn),
b1 is divergence-free, div b1 = 0, and b1 ∈BMO−1(Rn). It means that b1(x) =
div A(x), A(x) is a skew-symmetric matrix, Aij = −Aji, and Aij ∈BMO(Rn).
Here BMO(Ω) is the space of functions f with bounded mean oscillation, i.e.
sup
x ∈Ω
0 < r < ∞
1
rn
Z
Br(x)∩Ω
|f(y) −(f)Br(x)∩Ω| dy < ∞,
where
(f)ω = 1
|ω|
Z
ω
f(y) dy.
Clearly, each divergence-free vector b1 can be represented as b1 = div A with a
skew-symmetric matrix A(x).

NIKOLAY FILONOV AND TIMOFEY SHILKIN
This Theorem mentions that the behaviour of the bilinear form
R
Ω
∇u · b η dx
already distinguish between general drifts and divergence-free drifts. First, let us
discuss general drifts. If b satisﬁes (2.1) then it satisﬁes the estimate (4.1) too. But
we can not use the condition (4.1) instead (2.1) for the regularity theory, as the
example of Remark 2.10 shows. Indeed, for functions satisfying
(4.2)
|b(x)| ≤
C
|x|
the estimate (4.1) is fulﬁlled by the Hardy inequality.
On the other hand, the case of the drift b having a one-point singularity (say, at
the origin) with the asymptotics which includes homogeneous of degree −1 functions
like (4.2), is also interesting. There are several papers, see [LZ], [Sem], [SSSZ] and
[NU], dealing with diﬀerent classes of divergence-free drifts which cover (4.2). All
these papers contain also the results for parabolic equation (1.8), but we discuss
only (simpliﬁed) elliptic versions of them. We address the interested readers to the
original papers.
The approach of [SSSZ] seems to be the most general one.
Assume b ∈
BMO−1(Ω) and div b = 0. In this case we understand the equation −∆u+b·∇u = 0
in the sense of the integral identity
(4.3)
Z
Ω
(∇u · ∇η + A∇u · ∇η) dx = 0
∀η ∈C∞
0 (Ω),
where the skew-symmetric matrix A ∈BMO(Ω) is deﬁned via div A(x) = b(x).
Theorem 4.2. Let b ∈BMO−1(Ω) and div b = 0. Then
1) The maximum principle holds. If u ∈W 1
2 (Ω) satisﬁes (4.3) and ϕ := u|∂Ω
is bounded, then ∥u∥L∞(Ω) ≤∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω). In particular, the weak solution to (1.6)
is unique.
2) Any weak solution u to (1.1) is H¨older continuous, u ∈Cα
loc(Ω) for some
α > 0.
For the proof see [NU] or [SSSZ]. The regularity theory developped in Section
2 is slightly better as it guarantees that weak solutions are locally H¨older continuous
with any exponent α < 1. Nevertheless, Theorem 4.2 means that divergence-free
drifts from BMO−1 can be also considered as regular ones.
Remark 4.3. Note that the case n = 2, b ∈L2(Ω), div b = 0, is the particular
case of this situation. Indeed, such drifts can be represented as a vector-function
with components b1 = ∂2h, b2 = −∂1h, where h is a scalar function h ∈W 1
2 (Ω).
By the imbedding theorem W 1
2 (Ω) ⊂BMO(Ω) we have
A(x) =

0
−h(x)
h(x)
0


5. Appendix
First we prove Theorem 2.9.
Proof. We present the proof in the case n ≥3 only. The case n = 2 diﬀers
from it by routine technical details.
ON SOME PROPERTIES OF WEAK SOLUTIONS
11
1) The statement similar to our estimate (2.5) (for more general equations) can
be found in [St]. In particular, in [St, Theorem 4.2] the following estimate for weak
solutions to the problem
(5.1)
(
−∆u + b · ∇u = f
in
Ω,
u|∂Ω= 0,
was proved:
(5.2)
∥u∥L∞(Ω) ≤C

∥f∥Lp(Ω) + ∥u∥L2(Ω)

.
On the other hand,
(5.3)
∥u∥W 1
2 (Ω) ≤C ∥f∥W −1
2
(Ω)
due to Theorem 2.8. Hence we can exclude the weak norm of u from the right
hand side of (5.2) and obtain the estimate (2.5) in the case ϕ ≡0. In general case
we can split a weak solution u of the problem (1.6) as u = u1 + u2, where u1 is
a weak solution of (5.1) and u2 is a weak solution to the problem (1.6) with the
boundary data ϕ and zero right hand side. For u1 we have (5.3) and for u2 we have
∥u2∥L∞(Ω) ≤∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω) by Theorem 2.6.
2) As b ∈Ln(Ω) we can complete the integral identity (1.2) up to the test
functions η ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω). Denote k0 := ∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω) and assume k ≥k0. Take in (1.2)
η = (u −k)+, where we denote (u)+ := max{u, 0}. As k ≥k0 we have η ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω)
and ∇η = χAk∇u where χAk is the characteristic function of the set
Ak := { x ∈Ω: u(x) > k }.
We obtain the identity
Z
Ak
|∇u|2 dx +
Z
Ak
b · (u −k)∇u dx =
Z
Ak
f(u −k) dx.
The second term vanishes
Z
Ak
b · (u −k)∇u dx = 1
2
Z
Ω
b · ∇|(u −k)+|2 dx = 0,
as div b = 0, and hence
Z
Ak
|∇u|2 dx =
Z
Ak
f(u −k) dx,
∀k ≥k0.
The rest of the proof goes as in the usual elliptic theory. Applying the imbedding
theorem we obtain


Z
Ak
|∇u|2 dx


1
2
≤C(n)


Z
Ak
|f|
2n
n+2 dx


n+2

,
and using the H¨older inequality we get
∥f∥L 2n
n+2 (Ak) ≤|Ak|
n+2
2n −1
p ∥f∥Lp(Ak).
12
NIKOLAY FILONOV AND TIMOFEY SHILKIN
So we arrive at
Z
Ak
|∇u|2 dx ≤C(n) ∥f∥2
Lp(Ω) |Ak|1−2
n +ε,
∀k ≥k0,
where ε := 2

> 0. This inequality yields the following estimate, see [LU,
Chapter II, Lemma 5.3],
esssupΩ(u −k0)+ ≤C(n, p, Ω) ∥f∥Lp(Ω).
The estimate of essinfΩu can be obtained in a similar way if we replace u by −u.
□
In order to prove Theorem 3.1 we need some auxiliary results.
Theorem 5.1. Assume n ≥3, b ∈C∞(¯Ω), div b = 0 in Ω, f ∈L1(Ω),
and assume u ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω) is a weak solution of (1.6) with ϕ ≡0. Then for any
q ∈

1,
n
n−2

the following estimate holds:
(5.4)
∥u∥Lq(Ω) ≤C(n, q, Ω) ∥f∥L1(Ω).
Proof. Assume q ∈
 1,
n
n−2

. By duality we have
∥u∥Lq(Ω) =
sup
g∈Lq′ (Ω), ∥g∥Lq′ (Ω)≤1
Z
Ω
ug dx,
where q′ :=
q
q−1, q′ > n
2 . For any g ∈Lq′(Ω) denote by wg ∈W 2
q′(Ω) a solution to
the problem
(
−∆wg −b · ∇wg = g
in
Ω,
wg|∂Ω= 0.
From Theorem 2.9 we conclude that for wg the following estimate holds:
∥wg∥L∞(Ω) ≤C(n, q, Ω) ∥g∥Lq′(Ω).
Integrating by parts we obtain
Z
Ω
ug dx =
Z
Ω
u(−∆wg −b · ∇wg) dx =
Z
Ω
∇u · (∇wg + bwg) dx =
Z
Ω
fwg dx.
Then for any g ∈Lq′(Ω) such that ∥g∥Lq′(Ω) ≤1 we get
Z
Ω
ug dx
=
Z
Ω
fwg dx ≤∥f∥L1(Ω)∥wg∥L∞(Ω) ≤C(n, q, Ω) ∥f∥L1(Ω).
Hence we obtain (5.4).
□
Another auxiliary result we need is the following extension theorem.
Theorem 5.2. Assume Ω⊂Rn is a bounded domain of class C1. Then there
exists a bounded linear extension operator T : L∞(∂Ω) ∩W 1/2
2
(∂Ω) →L∞(Ω) ∩
W 1
2 (Ω) such that
T ϕ|∂Ω= ϕ,
∀ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω) ∩W 1/2
2
(∂Ω),
∥T ϕ∥W 1
2 (Ω) ≤C(Ω) ∥ϕ∥W 1/2
2
(∂Ω),
∥T ϕ∥L∞(Ω) ≤C(Ω) ∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω).
ON SOME PROPERTIES OF WEAK SOLUTIONS
13
Proof. For the sake of completeness we brieﬂy recall the proof of Theorem
5.2. After the localization and ﬂattening of the boundary it is suﬃcient to construct
the extension operator from Rn−1 to Rn
+ := Rn−1 × (0, +∞). Then we can take the
standard operator
(T ϕ)(x′, xn) = η(xn)
Z
Rn−1
ϕ(x′ −xnξ′)ψ(ξ′) dξ′,
(x′, xn) ∈Rn
+,
where x′ := (x1, . . . , xn−1) ∈Rn−1, η ∈C∞
0 (R), η(0) = 1, ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rn−1),
R
Rn−1
ψ(ξ′) dξ′ = 1. This operator is bounded from W 1/2
2
(Rn−1) to W 1
2 (Rn
+) and
also from L∞(Rn−1) to L∞(Rn
+). More details can be found in [BIN].
□
Now we can give an elementary proof of Theorem 3.1.
Proof. The function vk := uk −u ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω) is a weak solution to the problem
(
−∆vk + bk · ∇vk = fk
in
Ω,
vk|∂Ω= 0,
where
fk := (b −bk) · ∇u,
fk ∈L1(Ω),
∥fk∥L1(Ω) →0.
Assume q ∈

1,
n
n−2

. By Theorem 5.1 we have
∥vk∥Lq(Ω) ≤C(n, Ω) ∥fk∥L1(Ω) →0,
and hence (3.2) follows.
Now assume additionally ϕ ∈L∞(∂Ω). Denote ˜ϕ := T ϕ where T is the exten-
sion operator from Theorem 5.2. Taking in the integral identity (1.4) for uk and bk
the test function η = uk −˜ϕ ∈
◦
W 1
2(Ω) we obtain
Z
Ω
|∇uk|2 dx −
Z
Ω
ukbk · ∇(uk −˜ϕ) dx =
Z
Ω
∇uk · ∇˜ϕ dx + ⟨f, uk −˜ϕ⟩.
Using the condition div bk = 0 we get
Z
Ω
ukbk · ∇(uk −˜ϕ) dx =
Z
Ω
˜ϕbk · ∇(uk −˜ϕ) dx.
Therefore,
∥∇uk∥2
L2(Ω) ≤

∥˜ϕ∥L∞(Ω)∥bk∥L2(Ω) + ∥f∥W −1

∥uk∥W 1
2 (Ω) + ∥˜ϕ∥W 1
2 (Ω)

+
+ ∥∇uk∥L2(Ω)∥∇˜ϕ∥L2(Ω).
Applying Friedrichs’ and Young’s inequalities we obtain the estimate
(5.5)
∥uk∥W 1
2 (Ω) ≤C,
with a constant C independent on k. As the convergence (3.2) is already established,
from (5.5) we derive (3.3).
Finally, if ϕ ≡0 then we have the energy identities for uk
Z
Ω
|∇uk|2 = ⟨f, uk⟩,
and using the weak convergence (3.3) we arrive at (3.4).
□
14
NIKOLAY FILONOV AND TIMOFEY SHILKIN
Now we turn to the proof of Theorem 3.3.
Proof. We take a sequence bk ∈C∞(¯Ω), div bk = 0, such that bk →b in
L2(Ω).
Let uk ∈W 1
2 (Ω) be a weak solution to the problem (3.1).
Repeating
the arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we obtain the estimate (5.5) with a
constant C independent on k. Using this estimate we can extract a subsequence
satisfying (3.3) for some u ∈W 1
2 (Ω). The weak convergence (3.3) and the strong
convergence bk →b in L2(Ω) allow us to pass to the limit in the integral identities
(1.2) corresponding to uk and bk. Therefore, u is a weak solution to (1.6).
□
Now we present the proof of Theorem 3.4.
Proof. Let bk be smooth divergence-free vector ﬁelds such that bk →b in
L2(Ω). Denote by uk the weak solution to the problem (3.1). By Theorem 2.9
(5.6)
∥uk∥L∞(Ω) ≤∥ϕ∥L∞(∂Ω) + C ∥f∥Lp(Ω)
with the constant C depending only on n, p and Ω. From Theorem 3.1 we have the
convergence uk →u in L1(Ω) and hence we can extract a subsequence (for which
we keep the same notation) such that
uk →u
a.e. in
Ω.
Passing to the limit in (5.6) we obtain (3.5).
□
Finally we give the proof of Theorem 3.5.
Proof. To simplify the presentation we give the proof only in the case f ≡0.
The extension of the result for non-zero right hand side can be done by standard
methods, see [HL, Theorem 4.1] or [FSh]. First we derive the estimate
(5.7)
∥u∥L∞(B1/2) ≤C
 1 + ∥b∥Lp(B)
µ ∥u∥L2p′(B),
p′ :=
p
p −1
(with some positive constants C and µ depending only on n and p) under additional
assumption u ∈C∞(B). We explore Moser’s iteration technique, see [Mo]. Assume
β ≥0 is arbitrary and let ζ ∈C∞
0 (B) be a cut-oﬀfunction. Take a test function
η = ζ2|u|βu in the identity (1.2). Denote w := |u|
β+2
2 . Then after integration by
parts and some routine calculations we obtain the inequality
(5.8)
Z
B
|∇(ζw)|2 dx ≤C
Z
B
|w|2 
|∇ζ|2 + |b| |∇ζ|

dx
Applying the imbedding theorem and the H¨older inequality and choosing the test
function ζ in an appropriate way we arrive at the inequality
∥w∥L 2n
n−2 (Br) ≤C

1
R −r + ∥b∥Lp(BR)

∥w∥L2p′(BR),
which holds for any 1
2 ≤r < R ≤1. Note that
2n
n−2 > 2p′ as p > n
2 if n ≥4 and
p = 2 if n = 3. The latter inequality gives us the estimate
(5.9)
∥u∥L nγ

with an arbitrary γ ≥2, γ := β + 2.
Denote s0 = 2p′, sm := χsm−1, where
χ := n(p−1)
p(n−2), and denote also Rm = 1
2 +
1
2m+1 . Taking in (5.9) r = Rm, R = Rm−1,
γ = sm−1
p′
we obtain
∥u∥Lsm(BRm) ≤

C 2m+1 + C∥b∥Lp(B)

1
χm−1 ∥u∥Lsm−1(BRm−1)
Iterating this inequality we arrive at (5.7).
Now we need to get rid of the assumption u ∈C∞(B). Assume u ∈W 1
2 (B)
is an arbitrary weak solution to (1.1). Let ζ ∈C∞
0 (B) be a cut-oﬀfunction such
that ζ ≡1 on B5/6 and denote v := ζu. Then v is a weak solution to the boundary
value problem
(
−∆v + b · ∇v = g
in
B
v|∂B = 0
where
g := −u∆ζ −2∇u · ∇ζ + bu · ∇ζ.
Note that g ≡0 and v ≡u on B5/6. As b ∈Lp(B) with p > n
2 we have g ∈W −1
2
(B).
Now we take a sequence bk ∈C∞( ¯B), div bk = 0, such that bk →b in Lp(B) and
let vk be the weak solution to the problem
(
−∆vk + bk · ∇vk = g
in
B
vk|∂B = 0
From Theorem 3.1 we have vk ⇀v in W 1
2 (B) and as p >
n
2 we can extract a
subsequence (for which we keep the same notation) such that vk →v a.e. in B and
vk →v in L2p′(B). As g ≡0 on B5/6 from the usual elliptic theory (see [LU]) we
conclude that vk ∈C∞(B5/6). Applying (5.7) (with the obvious modiﬁcation in
radius) we obtain the estimate
∥vk∥L∞(B1/2) ≤C
 1 + ∥bk∥Lp(B)
µ ∥vk∥L2p′(B3/4).
Hence vk are equibounded on B1/2. Passing to the limit in the above inequality
and taking into account that v = u on B5/6 we obtain
∥u∥L∞(B1/2) ≤C
 1 + ∥b∥Lp(B)
µ ∥u∥L2p′(B3/4).
To conclude the proof we remark that for p > n
2 from the imbedding theorem we
have
∥u∥L2p′(B) ≤C(n, p) ∥u∥W 1
2 (B).
