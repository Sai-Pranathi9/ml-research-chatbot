STOCHASTIC STABILITY OF SECTIONAL-ANOSOV FLOWS
R.J. METZGER AND C.A. MORALES
Abstract. A sectional-Anosov ﬂow is a vector ﬁeld on a compact manifold
inwardly transverse to the boundary such that the maximal invariant set is
sectional-hyperbolic (in the sense of [12]). We prove that any C2 transitive
sectional-Anosov ﬂow has a unique SRB measure which is stochastically stable
under small random perturbations.
1. Introduction
We shall study the SRB measures were discovered by Sinai, Bowen and Ruelle
in the 70’s. More precisely, we will concerned with continuous-time systems, i.e.,
vector ﬁelds and their corresponding ﬂows. The motivation comes from ﬂow’s
counterpart of this discovering [4] implying that such measures do exist for any
C2 Anosov ﬂow on a compact manifold. Naturally, this conduces to the follow-
ing question: Can the existence SRB measures be proved for dynamical systems
beyond the Anosov ones?
An important case is that of the sectional-Anosov
ﬂows deﬁned in [13]. These ﬂows extend the Anosov ones to include important
examples like the geometric and multidimensional Lorenz attractors [1], [6], [3]
and, speciﬁcally, Lorenz’s polynomial ﬂow [9], [16]. We therefore ask if, likewise
Anosov’s, every C2 sectional-Anosov ﬂow on a compact manifold carries a SRB
measure. Positive answer for the geometric Lorenz attractor is nowadays folck-
lore. For general C2 sectional-Anosov ﬂows on compact 3-manifolds the answer is
positive (with unicity) in the transitive case. This can be deduced from [5] (with
the assumption that the periodic points are dense in the maximal invariant set)
and from [2] (without such an assumption). Recently, Sataev pursued these last
two results to the codimension one nontransitive case [15]. Important examples
which are not sectional-Anosov were considered by the ﬁrst author [10], [11].
In this paper we shall give positive answer in the transitive case in any di-
mension (extending so [2], [5] and, partially, [15]). More precisely, we prove that
every C2 transitive sectional-Anosov ﬂow on a compact manifold has a unique
SRB measure. Furthermore, such a measure is stochastically stable under small
random perturbations (extending so Kifer [7] who proved stochastic stability in
the case of the geometric Lorenz attractor). This result answers in positive to

a question formulated to the ﬁrst author by Viana in the speciﬁc case of the
multidimensional Lorenz attractor. Let us state our result in a precise way.
Hereafter X will be a C1 vector ﬁeld of a compact manifold M inwardly trans-
verse to the boundary ∂M (if nonempty). Denote by Xt the ﬂow generated by
X and deﬁne the maximal invariant set
M(X) =
\
t≥0
Xt(M).
We say that X is transitive if M(X) = ω(x) for some x ∈M(X), where ω(x) is
the omega-limit set of x,
ω(x) =
n
y ∈M : y = lim
k→∞Xtk(x) for some sequence tk →∞
o
.
We say that Λ ⊂M(X) is invariant if Xt(Λ) = Λ for all t ∈R. A compact
invariant set Λ is hyperbolic if there are a tangent bundle decomposition TΛM =
Es
Λ ⊕EX
Λ ⊕Eu
Λ over Λ as well as positive constants K, λ and a Riemannian metric
∥· ∥on M satisfying
(1) Es
x ̸= 0 and Eu
x ̸= 0 for all x ∈Λ;
(2) ∥DXt(x)/Es
x| ≤Ke−λt, for every x ∈Λ and t ≥0;
(3) EX
Λ is the subbundle generated by X;
(4) m(DXt(x)/Eu
x) ≥K−1eλt, for every x ∈Λ and t ≥0, where m(·) indicates
the conorm operation.
We say that X is an Anosov ﬂow if M(X) is a hyperbolic set of X.
On the other hand, a compact invariant set Λ is sectional-hyperbolic if every
singularity in Λ is hyperbolic and, also, there are a decomposition TΛM = Es
Λ⊕Ec
Λ
of the tangent bundle over Λ as well as positive constants K, λ and a Riemannian
metric ∥· ∥on M satisfying
(1) ∥DXt(x)/Es
x∥≤Ke−λt for every x ∈Λ and t ≥0.
(2)
∥DXt(x)/Es
x∥
m(DXt(x)/Ecx) ≤Ke−λt, for every x ∈Λ and t ≥0.
(3) | det(DXt(x)/Lx)| ≥K−1eλt for every x ∈Λ, t ≥0 and every two-
dimensional subspace Lx of Ec
x.
We say that X is a sectional-Anosov ﬂow if M(X) is a sectional-hyperbolic set.
A Borel probability measure µ of M is invariant if (Xt)∗(µ) = µ for every t ≥0.
If, additionally, it has positive Lyapunov exponent a.e.
and, also, absolutely
continuous conditional measure on the corresponding unstable manifolds, then
we say that µ is an SRB measure of X (see [17] for further details).
Next we introduce some basics on random perturbations of dynamical systems
[7]. Consider the family of transition probability measures P ε(t, x, ·) on M given
for every x ∈M and t ∈IR (or t ∈Z+) and ε > 0 small enough and deﬁne
Markov chains xε
t, t ∈IR in the following way: if xε
t = x then xε
t+τ has probability
P ε(τ, x, A) of being in A. The Markov chain xε
t for t ∈IR is called a small random

perturbation of a ﬂow Xt if for every continuous function h on M, we have

M
P ε(t, x, dy)h(y) −h(Xt(x))
 = 0 .
Similarly, the Markov chain xε
n for n ∈Z+ is called a small random perturbation
of a map f if for every continuous function h on M, we have
lim
ε→0

Z
M
P ε(n, x, dy)h(y) −h(f n(x))
 = 0.
A probability measure νε on M is a stationary measure for the Markov chain xε
t
if for all Borel set A and any τ > 0, we have
Z
M
νε(dx)P ε(τ, x, A) = νε(A).
Denote by B(M) the set of borelians of M. Suppose that X has a unique SRB
measure µ.
Let P ε : IR+ × M × B(M) →[0, 1] be the transition probability
measures associated to a ﬁxed small random perturbation xε
t of X and {µε}ε>0
be a family of stationary measures of P ε. We say that µ is stochastically stable if
for every real number sequence εi →0+ such that µεi →ν in the weak sense one
has ν = µ.
By stochastic stability under small diﬀussion-type random perturbations it is
meant that we are going to use transition probabilities of the form
P ε(τ, x, A) =
Z
A
pε(τ, x, y)dy,
where dy means integration with respect to the natural Lebesgue measure of the
manifold and pε(τ, x, y) is a solution of the diﬀusion equation
∂pε
∂t (t, x, y) = (εL + X)pε(t, x, y)
with L being an elliptic operator. Note that the elliptic operator introduces the
posibility of collision with particle in a media (or heat equation), that gives the
random part of the Markov chains. Typical solution of this equation comes with
a factor that has Gaussian behaviour, namely, pε(t, x, y) ∼exp( −dist(Xt(x),y)
ε
).
Now we state our result.
Theorem A. Every C2 transitive sectional-Anosov ﬂow on a compact manifold
has a unique SRB measure which is stochastically stable under small diﬀusion-
type random perturbations.
This result (announced twice in [12] and [14]) extend the recent paper by
Leplaideur and Yang [8].

2. Preliminaries
This section is to give the results needed to prove 2.1 in [7], which is essentially
a linear version of the perturbation and only need hyperbolic behaviour along
orbits. This can be achieved if the orbits remains outside the singularities as it
is shown in the following propositions and lemmas.
Hereafter X will be a C2 transitive sectional-Anosov ﬂow of a compact manifold
M.
Lemma 1 (Shadowing Lemma). There exists a constant C such that if x0, . . . , xn
is a δ-pseudo-orbit of F = Xτ satisfying
(1)
min
0≤i≤n dist(xi, Sing(X)) > Cδ,
then one can ﬁnd a point y ∈M such that
(2)
max
0≤i≤n dist(xi, F iy) ≤Cnδ
Proposition 2. There are positive constants γ > 0 and α > 0, not depending on
y ∈M, such that for any y ∈M that shadows a δ-pseudo-orbit as above there is
an invariant splitting
TF lyM = ˜HF ly ⊕Hu
F ly,
l ∈IN,
satisfying
∠( ˜HF ly, Hu
F ly) > α
and
||DF −lζ|| ≤γ−1e−γl||ζ||,
∀l ∈IN.
Let J(x) be the absolute value of the Jacobian of the derivative of F at
x, and Jn(x) the absolute value of the Jacobian of the F n at x.
Deﬁne also
dn(x, y) = max{dist(F kx, F ky), 0 ≤|k| ≤|n| and
kn ≥0} and Kρ(x, n) =
{y : dn(x, y) ≤ρ}.
Proposition 3 (Volume Lemma). Then there exists ˜ρ, Cρ, C > 0 such that for
any positive ρ ≤˜ρ, n ≥0 and x ∈M(X)
(3)
C−1
ρ
≤m(Kρ(x, n)Jn(x) ≤Cρ
where m is the Riemannian volume, and for each y ∈Kρ(x, n)
(4)
C−1 ≤Jn(x, n)(Jn(y))−1 ≤C
If X has no singularities (hence Anosov) and F = Xτ then (3) remains true and
(4) must be replaced by
(5)
C−1 ≤Jn(F ux)(Jn(y))−1 ≤C
with |u| ≤cρ, where c ≥0 depends only on X.

3. Proof of Theorem A
Let X be a C2 transitive sectional-Anosov ﬂow of a compact manifold M. Denote
by Sing(X) the set of singularities of X. If Sing(X) = ∅then X is Anosov and
then the result follows from classical results [7]. Then, we can assume that X is a
genuine sectional-Anosov ﬂow, i.e., Sing(X) ̸= ∅. We keep in mind the notation
concerning small random perturbations as in the Introduction.
The proof of Theorem A is based on following lemmas to be proved in the ﬁnal
sections.
Lemma 4. Given ǫ > 0 small there is C > 0 such that if γ > 0 is small, then
∀x ∈M, ∀k ≥log(ε−m) one has
P ε(k, x, Bε1−γ(Sing(X))) ≤Cεγ
This means that the probability that a Markov chain arrives too close to the
singularities is very small, while the next one means that for those which do not
get close to the singularities we have the absolutely continuous property.
Recall that B(M) denotes the set of borelians of M. We denote by [E, D] a rec-
tangle consisting of points [x, y] = W s
η(x) ⋔W u
ρ (y), for local invariant manifolds,
with small enough η and ρ (see [7] p. 142-143).
Lemma 5. For every ε > 0 small there is C > 0 such that ∀1 > γ > 0, ∀x ∈M
and ∀Q ∈B(M), with dist(Q, Sing(X)) > 0, of the form Q = [E, D] one has
Iε
0(ε1−γ, n, x, Q) ≤Cmesu(E) + O(ε),
where:
• mesu is the Lebesgue measure in the unstable direction;
• Iε
0(ρ, n, x, Γ) = P ε
x{min0≤k≤n−1 dis(xε
k, Sing(Λ)) ≥ρ and xε
n ∈Γ};
• xε
k is the Markov chain induced by the time τ-map Xτ;
• P ε
x{xε
n ∈Γ} = P ε(n, x, Γ).
• n ≥(log(ε))2
With these lemmas we are ready to prove our theorem.
We know by deﬁnition that
µε(Γ) =
Z
M
P ε(n, x, Γ)dµε(x),
for every n, x and Γ. We shall need the inequality
(6)
P ε(n, x, [E, D]) ≤C · mesu(E) + O(ε)
because it implies
µε([E, D]) ≤C · mesu(E) + O(ε).
If ǫi →0+ as i →∞and µεi →µ∗then we have
µ∗([E, D]) ≤C · mesu(E)
6
R.J. METZGER AND C.A. MORALES
which proves that µ∗is absolutely continuous in the unstable direction and sup-
ported in M(X). Since M(X) is sectional-hyperbolic we have that every point
of M(X) has at least one positive Lyapunov exponent, so µ∗is a SRB measure
of X. This argument shows that M(X) supports SRB measures. Once we prove
that there is only one SRB measure in M(X) we simultaneously prove the desired
stochastic stability. So, the proof of Theorem A needs the following claim:
Claim 6. M(X) supports a unique SRB measure.
Proof. Since µ∗is absolutely continuous with respect to mesu and M(X) is tran-
sitive, we obtain that µ∗is positive in open sets in the unstable direction so it is
equivalent to mesu. If ν∗were another SRB measure supported in M(X) then ν∗
is absolutely continuous with respect to mesu so it is also absolutely continuous
with respect to µ∗. But ν∗is ergodic as it is SRB so ν∗and µ∗are the same.
This proves the claim.
□
Now we turn on to the proof of (6). This is merely a computation using lemmas
4 and 5: For all n, ρ and Γ as above one has
P ε(n, x, Γ) = P ε
x{xε
n ∈Γ} = P ε
x{ min
0≤k≤n−1 dist(xε
k, Sing(X)) ≥ρ and xε
k ∈Γ}

x{∃k : dist(xε
n, Sing(X)) < ρ, and xε
n ∈Γ}
= Iε
0(ρ, n, x, Γ) + P ε
x{∃k : dist(xε
k, Sing(X) < ρ, and xε
n ∈Γ}.
Replacing Γ = [E, D] and taking n ∈[(log ε)2, (log ε)4] and ρ = ε1−γ we obtain
by lemmas 4-5 that
P ε(n, x, [E, D]) ≤C · mesu(E) + O(ε)
proving (6).
4. Proof of Lemma 5
In the ﬂow case(1), set ˜W s
ρ(Γ) = S
|t|≤ρ W s
ρ(Γ). For diﬀeomorphisms, set ˜W s
ρ(Γ) =
W s
ρ(Γ).
It is enought to prove the lemma for the case where E = W u
η (z) and D =

ρ(z) ∩M(X), for all z ∈M(X) and ρ, η > 0.
Choose vi ∈E for i = 1, . . . , kε such that

Then for ε small enough

ρ(E)) ≤I1(ρ, δ(ε), n(ε), x, ˜W s

ε1−2β(M(X))) + O(ε).
where δ(ε) is chosen so that we can approximate transition probabilities of Markov
chains with transition probabilities of Markov chains that are also δ(ε)-pseudo-
orbits. If we choose δ(ε) = ε1−β with 0 < β < α and small (to be chosen later)
the error is of the order of exp(−β/3). Also, to make this approximation we need
n(ε) > (log(ε)2. But,

From the deﬁnition, for each x ∈W s
ε1−2β(M(X)) there exists ˜x such that x ∈

For each ˜x, take Gε
j = W u
jε(˜x)\W u
(j−1)ε(˜x), j = 1, 2, . . . , ⌊ε−4β⌋+ 1. So, for each
i, j we have that Gε
j ∩F n(ε)W s
2ρ(vi) consists of points zijk for k = 1, . . . , kij.
If w = (x, y, . . . , yn) is a δ(ε)-pseudo-orbit, with x ∈W s
ε1−2β(˜x), ˜x ∈Λ, yn ∈Aε
i
then there exists yw such that dist(yl, F lyw) ≤Cnε1−2β, for all l = 10, . . . , n,
using the Shadowing Lemma (see Lemma 1), where yw ∈˜W s

F n(ε)yw ∈˜W s

That is, there exists i, j, k such that j ≤⌊ε−4β⌋+ 1 and dist(F lyw, Flzijk) ≤

After this preparation we can lift the problem to the tangent bundle in the same
way as in Theorem 4.1 of Kifer [7] which essentially uses the Volumen Lemma
3 and Theorem 2.1 and 3.10 of [7]. Observe that we can use Theorem 2.1 of [7]
because for pseudo-orbits not aproaching the set Sing(Λ) our transformations
behaves like a hyperbolic one, see propositions 2 and 3.

where 1 > β > 0 and [ · ] means the integral part. It is not diﬁcult to show that
with this deﬁnition we have
(11)
(D + 1)l+1 ≤e−β/2
We also use β to aproximate the probability with ε1−β-pseudo-orbits using Lemma
1.1 of [7] (p. 101) and obtain the following inequality
P ε(l, x, Γ) ≤I1(ε1−β, l, Γ) + Clε−2mmes(Γ) exp(−αε1−β
