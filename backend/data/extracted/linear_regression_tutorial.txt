Abstract
We consider a two-phase Darcy ﬂow in a fractured and deformable porous medium for which the fractures are
described as a network of planar surfaces leading to so-called hybrid-dimensional models. The fractures are assumed
open and ﬁlled by the ﬂuids and small deformations with a linear elastic constitutive law are considered in the matrix.
As opposed to [10], the phase pressures are not assumed continuous at matrix fracture interfaces, which raises new
challenges in the convergence analysis related to the additional interfacial equations and unknowns for the ﬂow.
As shown in [16, 2], unlike single-phase ﬂow, discontinuous pressure models for two-phase ﬂows provide a better
accuracy than continuous pressure models even for highly permeable fractures. This is due to the fact that fractures
fully ﬁlled by one phase can act as barriers for the other phase, resulting in a pressure discontinuity at the matrix
fracture interface.
The model is discretized using the gradient discretization method [22], which covers a large class of conforming
and non conforming schemes.
This framework allows for a generic convergence analysis of the coupled model
using a combination of discrete functional tools. In this work, the gradient discretization of [10] is extended to
the discontinuous pressure model and the convergence to a weak solution is proved. Numerical solutions provided
by the continuous and discontinuous pressure models are compared on gas injection and suction test cases using a
Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) ﬁnite volume scheme for the ﬂows and P2 ﬁnite elements for the mechanics.

Introduction
Coupled ﬂow and geomechanics play an important role in many subsurface processes such as water management,
geothermal energy, CO2 sequestration, oil and gas production or nuclear waste storage. This is particularly the case
in the presence of fractures which have a strong impact both on the ﬂow and on the rock mechanical behavior. This
work considers the so called hybrid-dimensional or Discrete Fracture Matrix (DFM) models representing the fractures
as a network of co-dimension one surfaces coupled with the surrounding matrix domain. The reduced ﬂow model is
then obtained by averaging both the unknowns and the equations in the fracture width and by imposing appropriate
transmission conditions at both sides of the matrix fracture interfaces. The mechanical model is set on the matrix
domain with appropriate boundary conditions on both sides of the fracture interfaces. This type of hybrid-dimensional
models has been the object of intensive researches over the last twenty years due to the ubiquity of fractures in geology
and their considerable impact on the ﬂow and transport of mass and energy in porous media, and on the mechanical
behavior of rocks. For the derivation and analysis of such models, let us refer to [4, 27, 40, 44, 6, 13, 15, 46] for single-
phase Darcy ﬂows, [9, 49, 45, 36, 14, 23, 16, 2] for two-phase Darcy ﬂows, and [41, 42, 38, 33, 34, 29, 39, 30, 52, 32]
for poroelastic models.
As in [10], this work focuses on a hybrid-dimensional two-phase Darcy ﬂow model coupled with a linear poroelastic
deformation of the matrix. The fractures are assumed to remain open and fully ﬁlled by the ﬂuids, and their propagation

over time is neglected. The Poiseuille law is used for the tangential velocity along the fracture network and extended
to two-phase ﬂow based on generalized Darcy laws. As in [17], the concept of equivalent pressure, used to extend the
poro-mechanical coupling to two-phase ﬂow, is based on the capillary energy density. This is a crucial choice to obtain
the stability of the coupled model.
In [10], the continuity of both phase pressures is used as a transmission condition at matrix fracture interfaces. This
is a classical assumption in the case of highly permeable fractures such as open fractures. As shown e.g. in [28],
this choice is fully justiﬁed for the case of single-phase ﬂows. On the other hand, in the case of two-phase ﬂow, this
assumption can lead to inaccurate solutions at the matrix fracture interfaces [16, 2]. This is in particular the case
when the fractures are fully ﬁlled by one phase and act as barriers for the other phase due to its very low relative
permeability within the fractures, hence leading to a pressure discontinuity. Let us refer to [2] for striking examples
including the desaturation by suction at the interface between the atmosphere and a low permeable and fractured
storage rock.
This potential inaccuracy of continuous pressure models motivates us to consider the extension of the analysis carried
out in [10] to hybrid-dimensional discontinuous pressure ﬂow models [36, 23, 16, 2]. For such ﬂow models, the Darcy
ﬂuxes between the matrix fracture interface and the fracture are modelled using a two-point ﬂux approximation
combined with an upwind approximation of the mobilities [23, 16, 2]. Following [23], the model also includes a layer
of damaged rock at matrix fracture interfaces. This additional accumulation term plays a major role in the numerical
analysis of the model and also improves the nonlinear convergence at each time step of the simulation [23, 12]. It must
be kept suﬃciently small to maintain the accuracy of the solution (see [23]). Following [10] and [23], this new hybrid-
dimensional poro-mechanical model is discretized using the gradient discretization method [22]. This framework is
based on abstract vector spaces of discrete unknowns combined with reconstruction operators. The gradient scheme
is then obtained by substitution of the continuous operators by their discrete counterparts in the weak formulation
of the coupled model. The main asset of this framework is to allow a generic convergence analysis based on general
properties of the reconstruction operators that hold for a large class of conforming and non conforming discretizations.
Let us point out that, with respect to [10], additional trace and jump operators need to be deﬁned in this framework,
along with new deﬁnitions of coercivity, consistency, limit-conformity, and compactness. The two main ingredients to
discretize the coupled model are the discretizations of the hybrid-dimensional discontinuous pressure two-phase Darcy
ﬂow and the discretization of the mechanics. Let us brieﬂy mention, in both cases, a few families of discretizations
typically satisfying the gradient discretization properties.
For the discretization of the Darcy ﬂow, the gradient discretization framework covers the case of cell-centered ﬁnite
volume schemes with Two-Point Flux Approximation on strongly admissible meshes [40, 6, 2], or some symmetric
Multi-Point Flux Approximations [51, 50, 3] on tetrahedral or hexahedral meshes. It also accounts for the families
of Mixed Hybrid Mimetic and Mixed or Mixed Hybrid Finite Element discretizations such as in [44, 15, 7, 32], and
for vertex-based discretizations such as the Vertex Approximate Gradient scheme [15, 23, 16]. For the discretization
of the elastic mechanical model, the gradient discretization framework covers conforming ﬁnite element methods such
as in [33], the Crouzeix-Raviart discretization [35, 20], the Hybrid High Order discretization [19], and the Virtual
Element Method [8].
The main objective of this work is to introduce the gradient discretization of the hybrid-dimensional poro-mechanical
model with discontinuous pressure at matrix fracture interfaces. Then, we prove the convergence of the discrete solution
to a weak solution of the model. Compared with [10], new diﬃculties arise from the interfacial additional nonlinear
ﬂux and accumulation terms including the damaged rock type. Assuming that the fracture normal transmissivity is
ﬁxed in the interfacial two-point ﬂuxes, i.e. that its fracture aperture dependence is frozen, we are able to prove the
convergence of the gradient scheme solution to a weak solution of the model. This assumption is rather mild since,
in practice, the solution depends only weakly on this fracture normal transmissivity as long as it remains much larger
than the matrix transmissivity. Concerning compactness estimates, the same techniques as in [10] are used: time
translates, uniform-in-time L2-weak estimates, and a discrete version of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem. In [10], where
ﬁelds deﬁned in matrix and fracture are related, matrix and fracture contributions have to be separated by a cut-oﬀ
argument (since the fracture width vanishes at tips). On the other hand, in this work, such a separation stems from
the model itself, but the damaged rock layer has to be embedded in the time translates of the saturations, by using
ad-hoc test functions combining the matrix and damaged layer rock types.
As in [10], the proof additionally assumes that the matrix porosity remains bounded from below by a strictly positive
constant, that the fracture aperture remains larger than a ﬁxed aperture vanishing only at the tips, and that the
mobility functions are bounded from below by strictly positive constants.
The assumptions on the porosity and
fracture aperture cannot be avoided since the continuous model does not ensure these properties, which are needed to
ensure its well-posedness. The assumption on the mobilities are classical to carry out the stability and convergence
analysis of two-phase Darcy ﬂows with heterogeneous rock types (see [26, 14, 23]).
The second objective of this work is to compare the discontinuous pressure poro-mechanical model investigated in
this work to the continuous pressure poro-mechanical model presented in [10]. Two test cases are considered. As in
2
[10], the ﬁrst test case simulates the gas injection in a cross-shaped fracture network immersed in an initially water
saturated porous medium. The second test case models the desaturation of a low permeable medium by suction at the
interface with a ventilation tunnel. The data set of this second test case is based on the Callovo-Oxfordian argilite rock
properties of the nuclear waste storage prototype facility of Andra. The geometry uses an axisymmetric DFM model
based on a simpliﬁed version of the fracture network at the interface between the storage rock and the ventilation
tunnel. In both cases the discretization is based on the Two-Point Flux Approximation ﬁnite volume scheme for the
ﬂows and second-order ﬁnite elements for the mechanical deformation.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the continuous hybrid-dimensional coupled model
with discontinuous pressures at matrix fracture interfaces. Section 3 describes the gradient discretization method for
the coupled model including the deﬁnition of the reconstruction operators, the discrete variational formulation and
the properties of the gradient discretization needed for the subsequent convergence analysis. Section 4 proceeds with
the convergence analysis. The a priori estimates are established in Subsection 4.1, the compactness properties in
Subsection 4.2 and the convergence to a weak solution is proved in Subsection 4.3. This convergence falls short, in
general, from identifying the limit matrix–fracture nonlinear ﬂuxes; this issue is discussed in Subsection 4.4, in which
an assumption is given on the limit fracture width under which the ﬂuxes can be fully identiﬁed. In Section 5, devoted
to numerical experiments, the discontinuous pressure model is compared to the continuous pressure model presented
in [10].

Without restriction of

key choice to obtain the energy estimates that are the starting point for the convergence analysis.
We make the following main assumptions on the data:
(H1) For each phase α P tnw, wu and rock type rt P tm, f, ˘u, the mobility function ηα

rt
is a non-decreasing Lipschitz
continuous function with values in r0, 1s, and Sw
rt “ 1 ´ Snw
rt .
(H3) For a “ ˘, the width ¯da and porosity ¯φa of the damaged rock are strictly positive constants.
(H4) b P r0, 1s is the Biot coeﬃcient, M ą 0 is the Biot modulus, and λ ą 0, µ ą 0 are the Lamé coeﬃcients. These
coeﬃcients are assumed to be constant for simplicity.
(H5) The initial matrix porosity satisﬁes ¯φ0

(H6) The initial pressures are such that p¯pα

(H7) The source terms satisfy f P L2pΩqd, hα

f P L2pp0, Tq ˆ Γq.
(H8) The normal fracture transmissivity Tf P L8pΓq is uniformly bounded from below by a strictly positive constant.
(H9) The matrix permeability tensor Km is symmetric and uniformly elliptic on Ω.
Let us denote by C8
c pr0, Tq ˆ ΩzΓq the space of smooth functions ¯v : r0, Ts ˆ pΩzΓq Ñ R vanishing on BΩand at

The operators Πm
Dp, Πf
Dp, Ta
Dp are assumed piecewise constant [22, Deﬁnition 2.12]. A consequence of the piecewise-
constant property is the following: there is a basis peiqiPI of X0
Dm
p such that, if v “ ř

A spatial GD can be extended into a space-time GD by complementing it with

For n P t0, . . . , Nu, we denote by δtn` 1

time step.
Spatial operators are extended into space-time operators as follows. Let ΨD be a spatial GDM operator deﬁned in

ΨDwp0, ¨q “ ΨDw0 and, @n P t0, . . . , N ´ 1u , @t P ptn, tn`1s, ΨDwpt, ¨q “ ΨDwn`1.
For convenience, the same notation is kept for the spatial and space-time operators. Moreover, we deﬁne the discrete
time derivative as follows: for f : r0, Ts Ñ L1pΩq piecewise constant on the time discretization, with fn “ f|ptn´1,tns
and f0 “ fp0q, we set δtfptq “ fn`1´fn

Notice that the space of piecewise constant X0
D-valued functions f on the time discretization together with the initial
value f0 “ fp0q can be identiﬁed with pX0

an element w P pX0

Properties of gradient discretizations
Let pDl
pqlPN and pDl
uqlPN be sequences of GDs. We state here the assumptions on these sequences which ensure that
the solutions to the corresponding schemes converge. Most of these assumptions are adaptation of classical GDM
assumptions [22], except for the chain-rule and product rule used in Subsection 4.2 to obtain compactness properties;
we note that all these assumptions hold for standard discretizations used in porous media ﬂows.
Following [23], the spatial GD of the Darcy ﬂow
Dp “
´
X0
Dp, ∇ν

is assumed to satisfy the following coercivity, consistency, limit-conformity and compactness properties.
Coercivity of Dp. Let CDp ą 0 be deﬁned by

Then, a sequence of spatial GDs pDl

Remark 3.1 (Consistency). In [23], the consistency is only considered for r “ 2. We have here to adopt a slightly
stronger assumption to deal with the coupling and non-linearity involving the fracture aperture df. Note that, under
standard mesh regularity assumptions, this stronger consistency property is still satisﬁed for all classical GDs.
Limit-conformity of Dp. For all q “ pqm, qfq P C8pΩzΓqd ˆ C8pΓqd´1, ϕa P C8pΓq, and v “ pvm, vfq P X0

c pΓqd´1
denotes the space of functions whose restriction to each Γi is in C8pΓiqd´1 tangent to Γi, compactly supported away
from the tips, and satisfying normal ﬂux conservation at fracture intersections not located at the boundary BΩ.
(Local) compactness of Dp. A sequence of spatial GDs pDl
pqlPN is said to be locally compact if for all sequences
pvlqlPNP pX0
DlpqlPN such that suplPN }vl}Dlp ă `8 and all compact sets Km Ă Ωand Kf Ă Γ, such that Kf is disjoint
from the intersections pΓi X Γjqi­“j, the sequences pΠm
DlpvlqlPN and pΠf
DlpvlqlPN are relatively compact in L2pKmq and
L2pKfq, respectively.

where ξ P Rd, η “ pηiqiPI with ηi tangent to Γi; for ξ and η small enough, this expression is well deﬁned since Km
and Kf are compact in Ωand Γ, respectively. Following [22, Lemma 2.21], An equivalent formulation of the local
compactness property is: for all Km, Kf as above,
lim
ξ,ηÑ0 sup
lPN
TDlp,Km,Kf pξ, ηq “ 0.
Remark 3.3 (Usual compactness property for GDs). The standard compactness property for GD is not local but global,
that is, on the entire domain not any of its compact subsets (see, e.g., [22, Deﬁnition 2.8] and also below for Du).
Two reasons pushed us to consider here the weaker notion of local compactness: ﬁrstly, for standard GDs, the global
compactness does not seem obvious to establish (or even true) in the fractures, because of the weight d0 in the norm
}¨}Dp, which prevents us from estimating the translates of the reconstructed function by the gradient near the fracture
tips; secondly, we will only use compactness on saturations, which are uniformly bounded by 1 and for which local
and global compactness are therefore equivalent.
In the following, for brevity we refer to the local compactness of pDl
pqlPN simply as the compactness of this sequence
of GDs.
Bounds on reconstruction operators of pDl

Theorem 4.1. Let pDl

described in Section 3.1. Let φm,min ą 0 and assume that, for each l P N, the gradient scheme (8a)–(8b) has a solution

We ﬁrst present in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 a sequence of intermediate results that will be useful for the proof of
Theorem 4.1 detailed in Subsection 4.3.
Remark 4.2 (Limit interface ﬂuxes). The theorem states that the limit functions satisfy all but the ﬁrst closure
equations in (6c). It does not, however, identify the limit interface ﬂuxes ¯Qα
f,a, α P tnw, wu. This identiﬁcation
requires the limit functions to satisfy an energy equality, which is known under some assumption on the limit fracture
width ¯df. See the discussion in Subsection 4.4 for more details.
4.1
Energy estimates
Using the phase pressures and velocity (time derivative of the displacement ﬁeld) as test functions, the following a
priori estimates can be inferred.
Lemma 4.3 (A priori estimates). Let pα “ ppα
m, pα
f q, u be a solution to problem (8) such that
(i) df,Dupt, xq ě d0pxq for a.e. pt, xq P p0, Tq ˆ Γ,
(ii) φDpt, xq ě φm,min for a.e. pt, xq P p0, Tq ˆ Ω, where φm,min ą 0 is a constant.
Under hypotheses (H1)–(H9), there exists a real number C ą 0 depending on the data, the coercivity constants CDp,
CDu, and φm,min, such that the following estimates hold:

(15)
Remark 4.4 (Existence of the discrete solution). Since these a priori estimates are obtained assuming lower bounds
on the fracture aperture and porosity, the existence of the discrete solution cannot be deduced from these estimates
and will be assumed in the following convergence analysis. As noticed in the introduction, these assumptions on lower
bounds of the fracture aperture and porosity are mandatory since the model itself does not account for possible contact
of fracture walls nor a nonlinear behavior of pore volume contraction, and thus cannot yield such lower bounds. The
analysis of a model with contact is a topic for future work.
Proof. For a piecewise constant function v on r0, Ts with vptq “ vn`1 for all t P ptn, tn`1s, n P t0, . . . , N ´ 1u, and the
initial value vp0q “ v0, we deﬁne the piecewise constant function ˆv such that ˆvptq “ vn for all t P ptn, tn`1s. We notice
the following expression for the discrete derivative of the product of two such functions:
δtpuvqptq “ ˆuptqδtvptq ` vptqδtuptq.

The above inequality,along with the fact that T can be replaced by any t P p0, Ts in the left-hand side, and in view
of (11)–(36)–(37), yields the a priori estimates (15) on pα
ν , pc,ν, pE
m and u. The estimate on df,Du follows from its
deﬁnition and from the deﬁnition (13) of CDu.

Compactness properties
Throughout the analysis, we write a À b for a ď Cb with constant C depending only on the coercivity constants CDp,
CDu of the considered GDs, and on the physical parameters.

We deduce from [5, Lemma 4.1] that T1 À τ ` ∆t. Similarly, using the time translate estimate (29) and the product
rule estimate on the sequence of GDs pDl
pqlPN, one shows that T2 À τ `∆t, which provides the time translates estimates
on Πm
Dpsα
m in L2p0, T; L2pΩqq and on Ta
Dpsα
a in L2p0, T; L2pΓqq.
Let us consider any compact sets Km Ă Ωand Kf Ă Γ. The space translates estimates for Πm
Dpsα
m in L2p0, T; L2pKmqq
and for Ta
Dpsα
a in L2p0, T; L2pKfqq derive from the a priori estimates of Lemma 4.3, the Lipschitz properties of Sα
m
16
and Sα
a , and from the local compactness property of the sequence of spatial GDs pDl
pqlPN (cf. Remark 3.2). Combined
with the time translate estimates above, the Fréchet–Kolmogorov theorem implies that Πm
Dpsα
m is relatively compact in
L2p0, T; L2pKmqq and that Ta
Dpsα
a is relatively compact in L2p0, T; L2pKfqq. Since Πm
Dpsα
m P r0, 1s and Ta
Dpsα
a P r0, 1s
it results that Πm
Dpsα
m is relatively compact in L2p0, T; L2pΩqq and that Ta
Dpsα
a is relatively compact in L2p0, T; L2pΓqq.

Proposition 4.8. Let pDl

f,lq P pX0
DlpqNl`1, α P tnw, wu, ul P pX0
DluqNl`1 such that
(i) df,Dlupt, xq ě d0pxq for a.e. pt, xq P p0, Tq ˆ Γ,
(ii) φDlpt, xq ě φm,min for a.e. pt, xq P p0, Tq ˆ Ω.
Then, the sequences pdf,DluqlPN and pdf,DluΠf

f qlPN, with sα,l

in time and weakly in L2pΓq, as per [22, Deﬁnition C.14].

Proof of Theorem 4.1. The superscript l will be dropped in the proof, and all convergences are up to appropriate

The identiﬁcation of the limit [15, Proposition 3.1], resulting from the limit-conformity property, can easily be adapted

The reason is that although the saturations Sα

Dp only converge weakly, which challenges the identiﬁcation
of the limits of their positive and negative parts (non-linear functions of the pressure jumps).
The expression of Qα
f,a is however monotonic in terms of the pressure jumps JpαKa
Dp, a feature that was used in [23,
Section 4.3] to identify the limit of these matrix–fracture ﬂuxes in absence of mechanical deformations. The argument
used there relies on a Minty technique (see, e.g., [22, Section D.5]).
A key ingredient to this argument relies on
being able to establish a energy equality for the limit of the approximations, which is done using the limit functions

Example of admissible triangular
mesh with three fracture edges in bold.
The
dot lines joining each cell center to the center
of each of its edges are assumed orthogonal to
the edge.
The discrete unknowns of the dis-
continuous pressure model are presented for the
two-phase ﬂow and the mechanics. Note that
the discontinuities of the pressures, of the satu-
rations and of the displacement are captured at
matrix fracture interfaces. Note also that addi-
tional nodal unknowns are deﬁned at intersec-
tions of at least three fractures.
themselves as test functions in the weak equations (6a)–(6b) they satisfy and using ﬁne integrating-by-parts in time
results from [21].
The caveat here is that space of test functions for (6a), which is C8
c pr0, Tq ˆ ΩzΓq ˆ C8
c pr0, Tq ˆ Γq, is not obviously
dense in the space of trial functions L2p0, T; V 0q, in which the limit pressures are found. Hence, it is not clear that
we can indeed use these limit pressures as test functions in (6a). The density issue comes from the fact that we would
need to ﬁnd smooth functions pϕα
f,kqkě1 such that ¯d3{2
f ∇τϕα
f,k Ñ ¯d3{2
f ∇τpα
f in L2pp0, TqˆΓq; in other words, we would
like smooth functions to be dense in the weighted space H1
¯df pΓq.
Such a density result has been established in [33], but under an additional assumption on the weight. Speciﬁcally:
¯df is bounded in time, smooth in space away from the fracture tips,
and, near the tips, ¯dfpt, x, yq « x
1
2 `ϵfpyq with ϵ ą 0
(above, x is the distance to the tip, y is the coordinate parallel to the tip, and f is smooth). Under this assumption,
the arguments of [23] can be reproduced and the limit ﬂuxes ¯Qα
f,a can be shown to satisfy the ﬁrst equation in (6c).

Numerical experiments
The objective of this numerical section is to compare the discontinuous pressure poro-mechanical model investigated
in this work with the continuous pressure poro-mechanical model presented in [10]. Two test cases are considered.
The ﬁrst one already described in [10] considers the injection of gas in a cross-shaped fracture network coupled with
the matrix domain initially liquid saturated. The second test case models the desaturation by suction at the interface
between a ventilation tunnel and a low-permeability fractured porous medium.
For both test cases, the ﬂow part of system (3) is discretized in space by a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA)
cell-centered ﬁnite volume scheme with additional face unknowns at matrix fracture interfaces [2]. The mechanical
part of (3) is discretized using second-order ﬁnite elements (P2) for the displacement ﬁeld in the matrix [18, 37],
adding supplementary unknowns on the fracture faces to account for the discontinuities. The computational domain
Ωis decomposed using admissible triangular meshes for the TPFA scheme (cf. [25, Section 3.1.2]) as illustrated in
Figure 4.
For the TPFA scheme, the GD operators Πm
Dp and Πf
Dp are respectively cell-wise and fracture face-wise constant. It
results that the porosity and the fracture aperture deﬁned by the closure laws (8c) will be projected in the matrix and
fracture accumulation terms (cf. ﬁrst two terms in (8a)) to cell-wise and face-wise constant spaces respectively. For
simplicity, this face-wise constant projection of the fracture aperture is also used in the fracture conductivity.

2 “ 0.001 days is the initial time step, ∆tmax “ 10 days in the ﬁrst test case and 10 years in the second
one, and ϱ “ 1.1. At each time step, the ﬂow unknowns are computed by a Newton-Raphson algorithm. At each
Newton-Raphson iteration, the Jacobian matrix is computed analytically and the linear system is solved using a
GMRes iterative solver. The time step is reduced by a factor 2 whenever the Newton-Raphson algorithm does not
converge within 50 iterations, with the stopping criteria deﬁned by the relative residual norm lower than 10´5 or a
maximum normalized variation of the primary unknowns lower than 10´4. On the other hand, given the matrix and
fracture equivalent pressures pE
m and pE
f , the displacement ﬁeld u is computed using the direct solver MA48 (see [24]).
The coupled nonlinear system is then solved at each time step using a Newton-Krylov acceleration [48] of the ﬁxed
22
point algorithm which, for a given displacement ﬁeld, solves the two-phase Darcy ﬂow problem, then computes the new
displacement ﬁeld given the new equivalent pressures (see [11] for more details). The stopping criterion is ﬁxed to 10´5
on the relative displacement ﬁeld increment. This Newton-Krylov algorithm is compared in [11] to the ﬁxed stress
algorithm [43] extended to DFM models in [31]. It is shown to solve the robustness issue of ﬁxed stress algorithms
w.r.t. to small initial time steps in the case of incompressible ﬂuids.
For this section, we introduce the following notation for the total stress:
σT “ σ0 ` σpuq ´ bpE
mI,
(40)
where σ0 is a possible pre-stress state [47, Section 4.2.4].

Gas injection in a cross-shaped fracture network
The data set of the continuous pressure model is the one described in [10]. We recall it brieﬂy here. We consider
the square Ω“ p0, Lq2 lying in the xy-plane, with L “ 100 m, containing a cross-shaped fracture network Γ made up
of four fractures, each one of length L
8 intersecting at p L
2 , L
2 q and aligned with the coordinate axes. The matrix and
fracture network have the following mobility laws: ηα
mpsαq “ psαq2
µα , ηα
f psαq “ sα
µα , α P tw, nwu, where µw “ 10´3 Pa¨s
and µnw “ 1.851¨10´5 Pa¨s are the dynamic viscosities of the wetting and non-wetting phases, respectively. Notice that
ηα
m and ηα
f do not satisfy the assumptions of our analysis, as they are not bounded below by a strictly positive number;
nevertheless, the results of the numerical experiments are not aﬀected by this circumstance. The saturation–capillary
pressure relation is Corey’s law:

with Rm “ 104 Pa and Rf “ 10 Pa. The matrix is homogeneous and isotropic, i.e. Km “ ΛmI, characterized by a
permeability Λm “ 3¨10´15 m2, an initial porosity φ0

Biot’s coeﬃcient b “ 1 ´ Kdr
Ks » 0.81, and Biot’s modulus M “ 18.4 GPa. The pre-stress state is assumed null: σ0 “ 0.
The domain is assumed to be clamped all over its boundary, i.e. u “ 0 on p0, Tq ˆ BΩ; for the ﬂows, we impose a
wetting saturation sw
m “ 1 on the upper side of the boundary p0, Tq ˆ pp0, Lq ˆ tLuq, whereas the remaining part
of the boundary is considered impervious (qα

pnw

T “ 1000 days “ 8.64¨107 s. The system is excited by the following source term, representing injection of non-wetting
ﬂuid at the center of the fracture network:

the Euclidean norm. The remaining source terms hw
f and hα
m, α P tw, nwu, are all set to zero.
To deﬁne the discontinuous pressure model, we consider additionally the normal fracture transmissivity Tf “ 10´8 m.
From Figure 5, it is clear that both the continuous and discontinuous pressure models provides roughly the same
solutions. Nevertheless, the continuous pressure model provides a rather smoothed non-wetting phase saturation at
matrix fracture interfaces while the discontinuous pressure model is more accurate as discussed in [2]. Also, Figure 6
shows the axial total stresses σT
x , σT
y , and the shear total stress σT
xy in the matrix at the ﬁnal time, for the discontinuous
pressure model; from the mechanics viewpoint, in this case the diﬀerence between the two models is not so remarkable.
As expected, stresses are concentrated in the neighborhood of fracture tips. To conclude this subsection, we give an
insight into the performance of our method in Table 1, where
• NbCells is the number of mesh cells,
• N∆t is the number of successful time steps,

Desaturation by suction of a low-permeability fractured porous medium
In this test case, we consider a hollow cylinder (Figure 7) made up of a low-permeability porous medium, containing
an axisymmetric fracture network, subject to axisymmetric loads – uniform pressures exerted on the internal and
external surfaces. Using cylindrical coordinates px, r, θq, the problem can therefore be reduced to a two-dimensional
formulation on the diametral section of the medium, shown in Figure 8 along with the fracture network, and the
displacement ﬁeld only consists of its axial and radial components:
upx, r, θq “ uxpx, rqex ` urpx, rqerpθq,
erpθq “ pcos θqey ` psin θqez,
0 ď x ď L,
Rint ď r ď Rext,
0 ď θ ď 2π,
where we have dropped time dependence for simplicity, and taken into account the system of cylindrical coordinates
in Figure 7, denoting by ex the axial unit vector, by er “ erpθq the radial unit vector, and by eθ the orthoradial unit
vector. The ﬁnal time for this simulation is set to T “ 200 years. The geometry is characterized by the following
data set: length L “ 10 m, internal and external radii Rint “ 5 m, Rext “ 35 m; two consecutive fractures are
spaced by 1.25 m. The matrix is characterized by the Lamé parameters λ “ 1.5 GPa, µ “ 2 GPa, by a permeability
Λm “ 5 ¨ 10´20 m2, Biot’s coeﬃcient and modulus b “ 1 and M “ 1 GPa respectively, and by an initial porosity
φm “ 0.15. The normal transmissibility of fractures is Tf “ 10´9 m and the initial fracture aperture is set to 10´2 m.
The matrix relative permeabilities of the liquid and gas phases are deﬁned by the following Van Genuchten laws:

The saturation–capillary pressure relation is again Corey’s law, as in (41), with Rm “ 2¨108 Pa and Rf “ 102 Pa.

Full saturation of the liquid phase is assumed at the initial state, both in the matrix and in the fracture network, with
an initial uniform pressure pw
0 “ pnw
0
“ 4 MPa.
Concerning ﬂow boundary conditions, the porous medium is assumed impervious (vanishing ﬂuxes) on the lateral
boundaries corresponding to x “ 0 and x “ L. On the inner surface r “ Rint, a given gas saturation is imposed:
snw
m
“ 0.35 on the matrix side and snw
f
“ 1 ´ 10´8 at fracture nodes, and atmospheric pressure patm “ 105 Pa
everywhere. On the outer surface r “ Rext, a liquid saturation sw
m “ 1 and pressure pw “ 4 MPa are imposed.
As for the mechanical boundary conditions, we impose a vanishing axial displacement ux on the lateral boundaries
corresponding to x “ 0 and x “ L. Moreover, on the same boundaries, the tangential stress is set to zero. On the
other hand, external surface loads g (uniform pressures) are applied on the inner and outer surfaces:
g “

N ą 0,
if r “ Rext,
´patmn, patm ą 0, if r “ Rint,
where n “ er for r “ Rext and n “ ´er for r “ Rint. We consider σT
N “ 10.95 MPa as the numerical value for the
uniform pressure on the outer surface.
As shown in Figures 9 and 10 strong capillary forces induce the desaturation of the matrix in the neighborhood of the
inner surface combined with a high negative liquid pressure. As exhibited in Figures 11 and 12 this negative liquid
pressure triggers the contraction of the pores as well as the spreading of the fracture sides. Figure 9 also displays
a comparison between the matrix non-wetting saturations obtained with the discontinuous and continuous pressure
models at ﬁnal time. It can be clearly seen that, unlike the continuous pressure model, the discontinuous pressure
model is able to capture the barrier eﬀect induced on the liquid phase by the fractures almost fully ﬁlled by the gas
phase. This is particularly remarkable at the intersection of the horizontal and oblique fractures. Figure 10 shows
a comparison of matrix equivalent pressures at ﬁnal time obtained for the continuous and discontinuous pressure
models; in the ﬁrst case, discontinuities at the matrix-fracture interface can be clearly detected. Figure 12 shows the
time history of the average fracture aperture for the continuous and discontinuous pressure models, with signiﬁcant
diﬀerences induced by the equivalent pressures pE
m computed in the two models. Finally, in Figure 13 we display
the radial, orthoradial, axial, and shear total stresses σT
r , σT
θ , σT
x , and σT
rx respectively in the matrix at the ﬁnal
time for the discontinuous pressure model. Again, stresses are concentrated in the neighborhood of fracture tips, as
expected. The arching eﬀect is clearly visible by comparison of the radial and orthoradial stresses in the neighborhood
of the inner surface. As expected, the radial stresses are transmitted across the horizontal fracture as opposed to the
orthoradial stresses. The comparison of the results given by the two models is shown in Figure 14, where a diﬀerent
behavior in the orthoradial total stresses σT
θ given by the two models along the vertical line x “ 5.5 (intersecting the
horizontal fracture) can be detected.
As in the previous subsection, we summarize also here the performance of our method in Table 2.

Conclusions
This work extends the gradient discretization and convergence analysis carried out in [10] to the case of hybrid-
dimensional poro-mechanical models with discontinuous phase pressures at matrix fracture interfaces. The model
considers a linear elastic mechanical model with open fractures coupled with a two-phase Darcy ﬂow. The Poiseuille
law is used for the tangential fracture conductivity and the dependence of the normal fracture transmissivity on the
fracture aperture is frozen. The model accounts for a general network of planar fractures including immersed, non-
immersed fractures and fracture intersections, and considers diﬀerent rock types in the matrix and fracture network
domains as well as at the matrix fracture interfaces.

Two test cases were considered to compare the continuous pressure hybrid-dimensional poro-mechanical model inves-
tigated in [10] to the discontinuous pressure model studied in this work. The ﬁrst test case simulates the gas injection
in a cross-shaped fracture network immersed in a two-dimensional porous medium initially water saturated. The
second test case is based on an axisymmetric DFM model and simulates the desaturation by suction at the interface
between a ventilation tunnel and a Callovo-Oxfordian argilite fractured storage rock. In both cases, it is shown that
the discontinuous pressure model provides a better accuracy at matrix fracture interfaces than the continuous pressure
model and allows in particular to account for the barrier eﬀect induced on the liquid phase by the gas ﬁlled fractures.
