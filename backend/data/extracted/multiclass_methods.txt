Abstract 
Recent analyses show that it is possible to produce a strong magnetic field at a very 
early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions (URHIC), therefore, the effect of 
homogeneity and constant strong magnetic field on the heavy meson spectrum 
quarkonium is studied which the states are described as charmonium and 
bottominum in a non-relativistic framework and by Debye screen potential. In 
particular, a model that takes into account potential isotopes emerging at the level 
of quark-static potential, as has been observed in recent studies. Investigation is 
performed with and without regard to the non-isotope of fixed potential, in order to 
better clarify its effects.  
Keywords: The N-dimensional radial Schr ̈dinger equation, finite temperature,

1. Introduction 
            The existence of quark–gluon plasma (QGP) was explored in the mid-
seventies [1, 2].  Recently, the URHIC events can be studied by combining the 
magnetic field effect as an extremely strong magnetic field, perpendicular to the 
reaction plane, is predicted to occur very early in collision phase while the event is 
off-central [3-7]. The magnetic field strength depends on the centrality and could 
be between   
  (≃     Gauss) at RHIC [8] to 10   
 at LHC [1]. In extreme 
situation, it is capable of achieving values of 50   
    During the electrical weak 
stage transition, an incredibly large magnetic field (∼    Gauss), was also 
rendered in early universe by the Higgs field gradients [9].  
The disorderly measurement of heavy quarkonium potentials is important to 
research the dissociation of quakonia [10, 11-13]. Over the last two decades, the 
dynamics the dissociation of quarkonium have been seen in a medium where, in 
the beginning the resonance was assumed to be dissociated if the screening is 
strong enough, i.e. the potential is too small to keep the pair appointed by   ̅ . 
Dissociation is currently considered primarily to be due to the increase in the 
resonance distance either due to an inelastic mechanism of spatially mediated 
dispersion by a patron such as gluons, known as Landau damping [14] or because 
of a process glue-dissociation in which involves hard thermal gluon in one-tone 
color state [15]. When the medium has lower T than BE of the basic resonance, 
process become dominant. Thus even at lower temperature, the quarkonium is 
dissociated even at lower temperatures where the likelihood of color processing is 
small [16]. In serval approach models, the effect of    on QCD thermo-dynamics 
has been examined [17–38].  
        There are a few of studies considered the effect of magnetic field on the static 
characteristic of quarkonium [10, 39-45]. Heavy quarkonia has been one of the 
study influence on the characteristics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions, 
as  quarkonia form in URHICs field as at a very period of ∼1/2   (where    is 
the mass of the charm or bottom quark), this is equivalent to the time scale at 
which the magnetic field is produced. Quarkonium and heavy meson spectroscopy, 
with an additional spin-spin interaction term were recently mechanically 
investigate with vacuum quantum with harmonic oscillators and Cornell potential 
[39, 42] in the presence of an external magnetic field. The effect of finite T and  
   on the real part of the   ̅ potential in the form of the destructive thermal QCD 
and the dissociation of heavy quarkonia due to the color screening have been 
studied [46]. In Ref. [16], the real part of the potential is included in the SE in order 
to determine the energy eigenvalues and energy eigenfunctions of the states of the 
  ̅. 
 The aim of the present work, we have analytically solved Schr ̈dinger equation 
using NU method in which the finite temperature and magnetic field are included 
in the potential interaction. For our best knowledge, the previous works are not 
solved the present potential analytically. In addition, the effect of the number of 
flavors is studied on the binding energy and the dissociation temperature of 
quarkonium. 
    This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the NU method. In 
Sec.3, the method is used to solve the N-dimensional SE. In Sec. 4, we discuss the 
results, and summary and conclusion are given in Sec.5. 
2. Theoretical Method   
The NU method [47] used to solve the second-order differential equation in the 
form is defined as follows

where  ̌    and    )  are max-second degree polynomials and  ̅(s) is the first 
degree maximal polynomials. By using the transformation of    =  (r),  
 (s) =  (s)  (s),                                                                                                  (2)                         
        
      
                              
as in Ref. [48], Eq. (1) can be written

where,

 then, the new eigenvalue equation becomes

determine whether the expression under the square root is square of expression. 
This is possible if the discrimination is zero. 
3. The solution of the Schrödinger radial equation in the presence of 
a strong magnetic field. 
As in Ref. [49], in the N-dimensional space, the Schrödinger equation for two 
particles which interact with symmetrical potentials takes form

where  , N and   are the angular momentum quantum number, the dimensional 
number, and the reduced mass. The following radial SE is obtained by applying the 
wave function   (r )=  
   
    (r) 
[
  
     +2   (E – V(r)- 
      
     
 
     
 )] (r) = 0.                                                            (12) 
In the present work, the potential takes the following form as in Ref. [50]. This 
potential depends on the radial distance. The effect of magnetic field will be 
appearing through the Debye mass. In addition, the anisotropy in the present 
potential with respect to the direction of magnetic field is not breaks the 
translational invariance of space, (see Ref. [46], for detail).  
    
V(r) = 
   
    ( 
       
 
 +   ) + 
 
  
 
   (1 -        ),                                                 (13) 
where,  
the string tension   = 0.18 Ge    in Ref. [16] 
  = 
    
                 
   
 
                                                                                              (14) 
where,  
   is the number of colors,    (    GeV) is an infrared mass which is interpreted 
as the ground state mass of the two gluons bound to by the basic string,     = 1.1 
(GeV) ,    = 0.385 (GeV) as in Refs. [51-53] and the Debye mass [53] becomes

    ,                             (15) 
where, 
 the first term is the contribution from the gluon loops and dependent on 
temperature and the magnetic field doesn't affect it. The second term is this term 
strongly depends on the    and is not much sensitive to the T of the medium. In 
the first term, where  ́ is the running strong coupling and is given by  
 ́ = 4     ́ (T),                                                                                                       (16) 
where, 
  ́ (T) is the usual temperature-dependent running coupling. It is given by 
  ́ (T) = 
   
(     
      )    
 
      .                                                                                   (17) 
where, 
   is the number of flavors,   is the renormalization scale is taken as 2   T and 
      0.2 (GeV) as in Ref. [16]. 
The second term is    =3.3 ,    is the quark flavor f = u and d,   is the magnetic 
field,   is the inverse of temperature and quark mass massive    = 0.307 (GeV) as 
in Ref. [54]. In Eq. (13),         is expanded up to second-order where    r   1 
is considered as in [55]. Eq. (13) is written as follows 
V(r) =       +      + 
  
                                                                                         (18)         
where,     
   = 
  
       ,                                                                                                       (19)

    ,                                                                                           (20) 
   = 
   
                                                                                                                  (21) 
By substituting the Eq. (18) into the Eq. (12), we get 
[
  
     +2   (E -       -    r - 
   
  - 
      
     
 
     
 )] (r ) = 0,                                        (22)       
Let us assume that   
 
  and    is the characteristic meson radius. So we could 
rewrite the Eq. (22) as in Ref. [56] 
[

    )]      = 0,                      (23) 
 The scheme is then based on  
 
  extensions   ,        and power series around 
    where    is a free parameter. Then, we have the scheme

Substituting Eqs. (24) into Eq. (23), we get

By comparing Eq. (25) and Eq. (1), we obtain  ̅(s) = 4x  ,    )=   and  ̌    = 2( - 
  +     -     ). Hence, Eq. (25) fulfils Eq. (1), therefore, the following NU 
method as  in Sec. 2,

The constant   is selected as it has a double zero under the square root, i.e. its 
discriminate  = 4   8   (1+      ) = 0. Hence,

Thus,

Also, in this section, we note the behavior of the real potential that plays a 
fundamental role in the current work. The quark-antiquark interaction potential is 
plotted a function of distance (r), where the T and    is included in the potential

in which   =3,      and g = 3.3 are taken.  
In Fig. (5), in the left panel, we plotted the real part of the potential as a function of 
r for different values of the magnetic field like

value of the    is increased the real-part is more screened. We noted that the

magnetic field (

attractive than

potential as a function of different temperature values like T        ,T       and 
T      for a fixed value of

screened by increasing the temperature. As a result, the real part of the potential 
was found to be more screened to increase the value of both T and   . This 
conclusion has been agreed with Ref. [16].

In Fig. (6), we have plotted the real part of potential as a function of the 
temperature and the magnetic field for the fixed value of r = 0.2 fm. To see the 
change of the potential with the strong magnetic field for the temperature range T= 
0.17- 0.3 GeV, we notice that potential is more attractive with a magnetic field 
than temperature. This conclusion is in agreement with [58].

4.1. Binding energy 
By solving Schrodinger equation as discussed in Sec. 3. We need to mention that 
the radial Schrödinger equation is numerically solved as in Refs. [46, 50]. We 
obtain  the BEs of    ̅and   ̅. In following, we see the change of the binding 
energy under the effect of temperature and magnetic field. 
Charmonium binding energy is plotted as a function of T for three cases    
    
  ,       
 and        
 . In Fig. (7), we show the effect of the   , 
temperature, and number of flavors on the BE of charmonium. We find that the 
BEs decreases with increasing T and magnetic field decrease. Besides, we have 
seen that the effect of temperature is more effective than the extremal magnetic 
field. This conclusion is in an agreement with works [16, 50]. Also, the binding 
energy decreases with increasing the number of flavors (  ) as shown in Fig. (7). 
The effect is not considered in other works.

T         ,T          and T      as a function of the magnetic field. We find 
that BE decreases with the magnetic field increases. By increasing the temperature, 
we notice the binding energy decreases. This conclusion is in agreement with 
works [16, 58].

notice that the binding energy of 1S bottomonium decreases. In the upper left 
panel, we took    = 0. Besides, the binding energy decreases when taking    = 2 
in the upper right panel. Finally, we find that the BEs decrease with the increase of 
   . At    = 3, as shown in the lower panel. As a result, we deduce that the 
   plays a role in the decrease of the BE. This finding is in agreement with works 
[16, 50]. A similar situation also observed for charmonium, except that the BE for 
charmonium is higher than that for bottomonium.

the    decreases. By increasing the temperature, we notice the binding energy 
decreases. Also, we note that the binding energy tends to zero that depends on the 
value of the temperature of the medium. This result is noted in Ref. [ 16,50].

4.2. Dissociation temperature for heavy quarkonia 
The dissociation of the binding state of the two bodies in a thermal medium has 
improved over the past two decades, as it was initially thought that the resonance 
would separate when the scan became strong enough, i.e. the potential is too small 
to carry    ̅ pair together. The dissociation is currently considered primarily to be 
due to the increase in the resonance distance either due to an inelastic mechanism 
of spatially mediated dispersion by a patron such as gluons, known as Landau 
damping [14] or because of a process glue-dissociation in which involves hard 
thermal gluon in one-tone color state [15]. When the medium has lower T than BE 
of the basic resonance, process become dominant. Thus even at lower temperature, 
the quarkonium is dissociated even at lower temperatures where the likelihood of 
color processing is small. 
 In the present study, we calculate the dissociation temperature at   ≃ , an 
approximation that provides good accuracy in the calculation of the dissociation 
temperature. In the current analysis, we also study influence of the    on the 
dissociation temperature in the presence of hot media for charmonium and 
bottomonium, using the calculated binding energies. 
In Table (1), the dissociation temperature (  ) is the minimum when the magnetic 
field at          
 . When     , the charmonium is dissociated at 2.22    
when        
 . At the case,         
  and         
 , are dissociated 
at 2.19    and 1.91   .When    = 2 charmonium is dissociated at 2.05    when 
       
 , in the case,         
  and         
 , are dissociated at 2.01 
   and 1.77   . We notice that   , in this case is lower  compared to     . When 
   = 3 charmonium is dissociated at 1.96    when        
 , in the case, 
        
  and         
  are dissociated at 1.93    and 1.7   .  
In the Table (2), at      bottomonium is dissociated with 2.1    when    
    
 , in the case,         
  and         
 , are dissociated at 2.05    and 
1.79   . When    = 2 bottomonium is dissociated at 1.94    when        
 , in 
the case,         
  and         
 , are dissociated at 1.9    and 1.65   . 
We note that    is lower compared to     . When    = 3 bottomonium is 
dissociated at 1.85    when        
 , in the case,         
  and    
     
 , are dissociated at 1.81    and 1.59   . This conclusion is agreed with Ref. 
[16, 50]. In Ref. [50], In the SE, it is used to the real part of potential and they have 
found that the real part of the potential is more screened and by increasing in the 
screening of the real part of the potential leads to the decrease of BEs of Υ and J/Ψ. 
Finally, they got the    for Υ and J/Ψ, which became slightly lower in the presence 
of a weak magnetic field. At eB= 0.5  
  they dissociated at slightly lower value 
1.13   and 3.94  . In Ref. [16], the    influences the binding of J/ψ and   . it 
reduces the binding of J/ψ but increases the binding of    . In the other hand, the 
magnetic field raises the width of the resonances because the temperature is too 
high. We eventually obtained the dissociation due to the Landau damping and 
noted that the   had risen in the presence of a   . At eB = 6  
   the J/ψ is 
dissociated at 2   , and with eB = 4  π, the   is dissociated at 1.1   . As the 
   increases further the    decreases.

By taking thermal medium at      , we note that the binding energy dissociated

 . The state of bottomonium is similar to that states of Table (4) but the 
dissociation of bottomonium is more than of charmonium. This conclusion is 
agreed with works such that [15, 59].

5. Summary and conclusion 
        In this paper, we find the dissociation of heavy quarks in hot QCD plasma in 
the presence of a strong magnetic field using a generalized    that depends on T 
and   . The SE is solved analytically using NU method, where the real potential 
includes the influence of the finite T and   . 
We consider the effect of the number of flavors, finite temperature, and magnetic 
field on binding energy and dissociation temperature. We found that the    has a 
basic role on decreasing binding energy. We have observed that the magnetic field 
is largely affected by large-distance interaction, as a result of which the real part of 
potential is more attractive. We report on the results for the values of the magnetic 
field at        
  ,       
 and        
 . We found the binding energy 
decreases by increasing the magnetic field. Also,  we measure that the    is above 
the critical temperature         GeV, and that the     of charmonium and 
bottomonium is lower in a strong magnetic field. This occurs because of the BE 
decreases by increasing the magnetic field. We note that the    decreases with an 
increase in the     and decrease with magnetic field values. We note that the 
dissociation temperature the of charmonium is greater than that of the 
bottomonium since the mass of charmonium is smaller than the mass of the 
bottomonium. This conclusion is agreed with results of Refs.  [16, 46, 50, 59].
