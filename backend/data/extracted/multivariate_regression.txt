Abstract—As the society becomes more dependent on the
presence of electricity, the resilience of the power systems gains
more importance. This paper develops a decision support method
for distribution system operators to restore electricity after
an earthquake to the maximum number of customers in the
minimum expected duration. The proposed method employs
Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal
restoration scheme. In order to determine the probability of the
ﬁeld component damage due to the earthquake, the Probability
of Failure (Pf ) of structures are calculated using the Peak
Ground Acceleration (PGA) values recorded by observatories
and earthquake research centers during the earthquake.

tribution Systems, Markov Decision Process.
I. INTRODUCTION
Restoring electricity1 fast after an earthquake is extremely
important, as the modern life relies on the presence of elec-
tricity. After an earthquake, some of the ﬁeld instruments may
get damaged. Considering that black-start of a system without
any structural damage is a difﬁcult problem, restoration at a
damaged system has many challenges. This paper proposes a
decision support method for distribution systems with dam-
aged instruments due to an earthquake. The proposed method
uses the probability of exceeding the damage state of failure
(Probability of Failure - Pf ) to determine the best restoration
strategy. Central to the proposed method is the construction
of a Markov Decision Process that encapsulates the system
topology, electrical constraints and damage probabilities (Pf ).
There are studies in the literature on the power system
restoration and disaster management problems [1]–[9]. While
[1] and [2] develop recovery plans for expected disasters, [3]
and [4] presents planning strategies to improve the power
system resilience. In [5], use of micro-grids in fast restoration
of power systems is evaluated. While [6]–[9] present online
disaster management methods based on ﬁeld sensor data, in
those studies ﬁeld component damage due to the earthquake
is neglected.

Under review.
This paper proposes an MDP based decision support method
to restore a medium voltage (MV) distribution system after
an earthquake. The method generates a restoration strategy
that minimizes the average expected restoration time over
the buses considering the real time data of the earthquake.
The proposed decision support method does not require any
additional infrastructure, such that basic SCADA data and Pf ,
which is determined from observatories, are sufﬁcient to run
the method.
The framework of the proposed method was ﬁrst introduced
in [10]. This paper enhances the model presented in [10]
by considering electrical constraints, such that a power ﬂow
algorithm runs along with the proposed method in order to
check if voltages of the system remain within the accepted
limits during the restoration actions. Moreover, Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) are also included in the problem
solution. In [10], the objective was deﬁned as minimizing
the total restoration time. However, it does not necessarily
minimize the expected restoration time of the buses. This
objective is achieved with the updated cost formulation. Note
that, the proposed method is designed to run after the earth-
quake occurs. The method utilizes real time earthquake data,
and determines the restoration strategy considering the ﬁeld
component damage probabilities.
The paper is organized as follows. The background informa-
tion is given in Section II and the proposed method is deﬁned
in detail in Section III. Numerical validation is provided in
Section IV, followed by conclusions in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. Probability of Failure (Pf )
Structures are constructed to resist the adverse effects of
reoccurring natural events such as earthquakes. Current design
speciﬁcations ensure the safety of a structure after a major
event with a certain return period. However, some of the
existing structures do not conform to the criteria speciﬁed by
the current design speciﬁcations. The behavior of these critical
structures during and after a major event could be estimated
by conducting a fragility analysis.
Fragility analysis is performed to estimate the seismic loss
of built environments. The obtained fragility curves represent
arXiv:1911.03317v2  [eess.SY]  11 Nov 2019
the probability of exceeding a damage limit state for a given
structure subjected to seismic excitation. For this research,
the critical limit state is deﬁned as collapse, and the fragility
curves obtained for the investigated structures, therefore, con-
sist of peak ground acceleration (PGA) versus Pf values. Thus,
by using the obtained fragility curves, it is possible to get
the Pf values associated with each structure for particular
excitation values (PGA). Note that PGA values are calculated
using the earthquake data recorded by the observatories.
B. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
MDP is a mathematical framework that is used to make
decisions in probabilistic environments. The policy synthesis
problem for MDPs concerns the generation of a policy opti-
mising the expected cost under the given constraints [11].
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is deﬁned by the tuple
M = (S,A, p,c), where S is a set of states, A is a set of actions,
p : S×A×S →[0,1] is a probabilistic action-conditioned state
transition function, i.e., given a state s ∈S and action a ∈A,
p(s
′|s,a) is the probability of transitioning from s to s
′ when
action a is applied, and c : S →R+ is a state cost function.
The set of actions that can be applied in a state s is denoted by
A(s). A deterministic policy π gives the action to be applied
in a state s π : S →A with π(s) ∈A(s). A value function
vn
π : S →R represents the expected cost obtained when policy π
is followed for n steps and it is recursively deﬁned as follows:
vn
π(s) =

c(s)

For a given state s0 ∈S, the optimal policy π∗is the policy

C. Power Flow Analysis
Among the power ﬂow analysis methods, such as Newton-
Raphson (NR), Gauss-Seidel (GS), fast decoupled load ﬂow
(FDLF), forward-backward power ﬂow (FBPF) [12], [13],
the proposed method utilizes FBPF method, because of the
radial structure distribution networks and high R/X ratio of the
distribution system power lines [14]. Implementation details of
FBPF can be found in [13]. The paper assumes proper load
and generation forecasts are provided, as the paper does not
develop any forecast algorithm.
This work assumes that DERs do not contribute to voltage
control, such that they aim to supply only active power, which
is a realistic assumption considering operating principles of
renewable sources. Therefore, DERs are modeled as negative
power demands in the FBPF algorithm. Note that, a DER will
only contribute to voltage control if it operates at island mode.
Considering that the system will be interrupted, to simplify
the problem, the FBPF solves single-phase equivalent network,
such that the system is assumed to be balanced. Once the
system is restored, the loads may be unbalanced, however, as
the medium voltage system is considered, the unbalance would
be limited.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
In this section, the proposed MDP based restoration policy
synthesis approach for the distribution system is explained.
Throughout the section, the number of buses, branches, and
DERs of the considered distribution system are represented by
N, L, and M, respectively. The notation IK is used to denote
the set of positive integers less than or equal to K, i.e., IK =
{1,...,K}
A. Model Construction
In the proposed MDP model M = (S,A, p,c), each state s ∈S
represents the current situation of all branches of the system.
Thus, each state is a snapshot of the distribution system. A
branch can be (1) damaged (D), or it has not been tried to
energized yet, thus its health condition can be (2) unknown
(U), or it can be energized (Ei), where the subscript i ∈{0}∪IL
denotes the major source of its energy. The index is 0 when
the source is the transmission grid, when i ∈IL, it is the index
of the DER feeding the branch. Thus, the set of states S is:
S = {s0,s1,...,sF} where si = [s1
i ,s1
i ,...,sL
i ] and
sk
i ∈{U,D}∪{E0,E1,...,EM}.
(2)
The total number of states, F + 1, is upper bounded by
(3+M)L according to (2). However, most of these states repre-
sent infeasible system conﬁgurations, e.g. energized branches
unconnected to a source, a DER supplying higher energy than
its capacity, or meshed structures. Such states are never added
to the model. Thus, in practice, the size of S is much less than
the given bound. Initially, all circuit breakers are assumed to be
open. Thus, the initial state of the system is s0 = [U,U,...,U].
Example 3.1: A network with 5 branches is shown in Fig 1,
where node 1 is connected to the transmission grid and node
6 is connected to a DER. The corresponding MDP state is
s2 = [E0,E0,U,U,E1] which indicates that the ﬁrst and second
branches are energized from the transmission grid, the circuit
breakers for the third and forth branches are open and their
conditions are unknown to the system operator, and the ﬁfth
branch is energized from the ﬁrst DER.

B. Action Set Construction
In a distribution network, a restoration action can be simul-
taneously applied to a set of branches that satisfy topological
and electrical constraints. In the MDP model, an action a ∈A is
deﬁned as the set of branches to be energized simultaneously,
A = {a|a ⊆IL}
(3)
and the constraints are integrated to the model trough the
feasible action sets A(s) for each s ∈S.
The restoration action can be applied to a branch i if is
in unknown condition (breakers are open) and it is connected
to an energized branch or a source. Let En ⊂IL denote the
branches that are connected to a source and B(i) ⊂IL denote
the indices of branches that are physically connected to branch
i, i.e., share a common end. Thus the set of branches for which
a restoration action can be applied in a state s = [s1,...,sL] is
deﬁned as
¯A(s) = {i | si = U and (i ∈En or
(4)
sj ∈{E0,E1,...,EM} for some j ∈B(i))}
Given a state s, the restoration action can be simultaneously
applied to branches from the set ¯A(s) ⊂IL that satisfy the
topological and electrical constraints. These constraints are
deﬁned with respect to the states that are one step reachable
from s, and they are formalized following the deﬁnition of the
state transition function in Sec. III-D.
C. Transition Function Calculation
In state s = [s1,s1,...sL], when action a ∈A(s) ⊆¯A(s) is ap-
plied, the probability of transitioning to a state t = [t1,t1,...tL]
satisfying (5) is given in (6). Essentially, by ¯A(s) (4) deﬁnition
si = U for all i ∈a and the status of these branches change to
D or Ek according to Pf (see Section II-A), where k denote
the source for the energized branch that has a common end
with i (C3). In addition, for a branch energized from a DER,
if an energized path to the transmission grid emerges as a
result of performing the restoration actions to the branches
in a, the status of this branch changes to E0 (C1), as after
a connection with the transmission grid is established, the
capacity limitation of the DER will vanish. No other branch
can change its status after a is applied (C2). The probability of
transitioning to a state that does not satisfy (5) is 0 as those
states are not one step reachable from s under the control
action a.

Example 3.2: The set of branches for which a restoration
action can be applied is A(s2) = {3,4} for the MDP state s2

s6 = [E0,E0,D,D,E1]
{3,4}

D. Feasible Action Set Construction
The subsets a of ¯A(s) (4) that satisfy the topological and
electrical constraints are added to A(s). These constraints are
formalized in this section.
Distance constraint: The restoration action can be applied
to two branches simultaneously if they are electrically distant
enough such that the transients emerging after the closure of
the circuit breakers do not cause signiﬁcant effects. In this
work, if two branches do not share a common end, they are
considered as electrically distant for simplicity.
T1: no two branch in a share a common end, i.e, i ̸∈B(j)
for any i, j ∈a.
Loop constraint: Meshed structures should be avoided in the
distribution system. Thus, a restoration action should not be
performed if it creates a loop of energized branches connected
to the same source.
T2: no state t ∈Post(s,a) represents a loop of energized
branches connected to the same source.
DER (Distributed Energy Resources) constraints: A
DER can only feed a limited number of buses due to its
capacity. Consequently, a restoration action connecting a bus
to a DER can not be applied if the total consumption of the
buses connected to the DER exceeds its capacity. Here, the
capacity of each DER and the load at each bus are assumed
to be known. The generation at ith DER is denoted as PG,i
and the load at ith bus is denoted as PL,i. Given a state
s = [s1,...,sL] ∈S and index of a source k ≤M, ActBus(s,k)
denotes the set of energized buses connected to the source k:
ActBus(s,k) = {i ∈IN |s j = Ek for a branch j
(8)
connected to bus i}
E1: for each t ∈Post(s,a) and DER k ∈IM, it holds that
 
∑
i∈ActBus(t,k)
PL,i
!
≤PG,k
(9)
Remark 3.1: If there is an energized path between two
DERs k,m ∈IM, then they are treated as one with capacity
PG,k +PG,m. In addition, the capacity of the transmission grid
is assumed to be inﬁnite; and thus, E1 is not checked for k = 0.
Voltage limitation constraints: The voltage of a bus must
be in permissible limits standardized between 0.95 pu and 1.05
pu. To guarantee that the voltage constraints are not violated
during the restoration, FBPF analysis is utilized during the
system construction. An action a is marked as infeasible at
state s if the voltage constraint for a bus is violated in a state
t ∈Post(s,a). Given the system topology, and the set of buses
energized from a source, the FBPF analysis gives the set of
buses at which the voltage constraints are violated.
E2: for each t ∈Post(s,a) and source k ∈{0}∪IM, it holds
that
|FBPF(ActBus(s,k))| = 0
(10)
Remark 3.2: For a state s, if no subset of ¯A(s) satisﬁes
all of the constraints, but some subsets of ¯A(s) satisﬁes T1,
T2, and E1 (thus only violate E2), then the permissible limits
are relaxed and the FBPF analysis is re-run. Note that the
relaxation of the voltage limits are limited with the power
quality standards.
The summarized construction method guarantees that all
system properties and constraints are integrated to the MDP
model through the admissible control sets A(s),s ∈S and
the transition function. Essentially, the construction guarantees
that the restoration actions from set a ∈A(s) can be applied
simultaneously when the conﬁguration of the distribution
system is s and the restoration actions a /∈A(s) violates a
topological or electrical constraints of the system.
The developed iterative MDP construction method is sum-
marized in Fig. 3. Initially, the set of unexplored states
is {[U,...,U]}, e.g., includes only the initial state. Then,
iteratively, a state s is taken from this set, the set of branches
¯A(s), that a restoration action can be applied, is computed as
in (4). Next, the subsets a of ¯A(s) for which the constraints
T1, T2, E1 and E2 are satisﬁed are added to A(s). If A(s)
only includes the empty set, a = {}, the permissible limits
for the FBPF analysis is relaxed and the constraint check
is repeated. Otherwise, for each a ∈A(s), p(· | s,a) (6) and
Post(s,a) (7) are computed, and the new states are added to
the set of unexplored states. The iterative process continues
until all of the reachable states are explored, which indicates
that the model construction is completed.
E. Cost Formulation
In this work, the goal is to minimize the average restoration
time for each branch. To achieve this task, the state cost is
deﬁned as the number of unenergized buses:
c(s) = N −

L[
k=0
ActBus(s,k)

(11)
Thus, for a policy π the n-step cost (1) of a state s is the
expected total number of unenergized buses over n-steps. For a
state s, vn
π(s)/N is the average expected time to energize a bus.
Considering that N is constant, the optimal policy π⋆is the
one that minimizes the average restoration time over the buses
for the considered horizon n. Here, the number of branches
L is used as the optimization horizon since the restoration
process is always completed in L steps, e.g., single source
radial branches.
Example 3.3: For the system shown in Fig. 1, consider s1 =
[E0,U,U,U,E1] and s7 shown in Fig. 4. Note that Post(s1,2) =
{s2,s7}. The costs for the states from Figs. 2-4 are c(s1) =
c(s7) = c(s9) = 2, c(s2) = c(s5) = c(s6) = c(s8) = 1, c(s3) =
Fig. 3. MDP construction ﬂowchart

s9 = [E0,D,D,U,E1]
s8 = [E0,D,E0,U,E1]
{3}
Fig. 4. Post(s7,{3}) for s7
c(s4) = 0. Consider a policy with π(s1) = {2}, π(s2) = {3,4},
and π(s7) = {3}. Assume that Pf (i) = 0.4 for each i ∈IL. The
value function over two steps for s2 and s7 are v2
π(s2) = 1.4
and v2
π(s7) = 3.4, and the value function over three steps for s1
is v3
π(s1) = 4.2. Given that the number of unenergized buses is
2 at s1, the average expected time to energize these branches
is 2.1 over a 3 step horizon.
As illustrated in the example, the optimal solution for the
ﬁnite horizon MDP policy synthesis problem gives the policy
that minimize the average restoration time over the considered
horizon thanks to the proposed state cost function (11). Thus,
the optimal policy gives the control action towards the states
with higher number of energized buses.
IV. CASE STUDY
The proposed method is applied to a sample system shown
in Fig. 5. Bus 1 is connected to the transmission grid, bus 6
and bus 10 are connected to DER-1 and DER-2, respectively.
The power consumption at each bus is assumed to be the same,
and the DER capacities are given as the number of buses that
it can feed. The policy synthesis results for different DER
capacities and different earthquake scenarios are presented in
Table I. For each case, initially all circuit breakers are open
and the branch statuses are unknown.
The size of the MDP model highly depends on the DER
conﬁguration as the number of the reachable states increases
with the number of DERs and their capacities. The effect of
DER capacity on the MDP model is shown by Cases 1 and 2

Fig. 5. 12-bus test system
given in Table I. In Case 1, the model has 449 states, while for
Case 2 there exists 1274 states. For example in Case 1, when
the system reaches state [E0,U,U,U,E1,U,U,U,U,U,E2], the
restoration process can only continue from branch 1 as the
DERs reached their capacity. On the other hand, in Case 2
for the same state, restoration process can continue from three
different branches thanks to the increase in the DER capacities.
The advantage of the DER capacity increase is the reduced
expected bus restoration time as observed in Table I, since a
DER with higher capacity can supply more customers, which
enables an extended islanded operation until the connection
with the transmission grid is established.
The inﬂuence of Pf can be observed when Case 2 and
Case 3 are compared. Note that, as all the branches have the
same Pf in those cases, the synthesized restoration strategy
will be the same for both of them. However, the average
expected restoration time is reduced as the Pf decreases. It
can be concluded that the proposed cost formulation, therefore,
provides the user an estimation over the damage status of the
system via the average expected restoration time.
In Case 4, the Pf of branch 4 is 0.7, and the rest of the Pf
values are 0.1. The resulting restoration action sequences are
shown below for cases 3 and 4. As seen, the method handles
different Pf values and generates a strategy accordingly.
Case3 :{1,5,11} →{2,4,10} →{3,6,8} →{7,9}
Case4 :{1,5,11} →{2,6,10} →{3,8} →{4,9} →{7}
In [10], the objective was deﬁned as minimizing the total
restoration time. For Case 2, the average expected restoration
time for the policy optimizing this objective is 5.52. Essen-
tially, minimizing the restoration time make the policy choose
the actions that likely end up in terminal states (A(s) = {/0})
regardless of the energized buses. Thus, it does not necessarily
minimize the average expected restoration time of the buses,
which is achieved with the new cost formulation.
The performance of the developed method is evaluated on
the IEEE-34 bus system with different DER conﬁgurations (up
to 2 DERs). The optimal policy is always synthesized within
10 minutes when Pf (i) < 1 for each branch. However, the
computation time reduces signiﬁcantly when some branches
are known to be damaged, e.g. Pf (i) = 1.
V. CONCLUSION
An MDP based decision support method for earthquake
affected distribution systems is developed in this paper. The
proposed method employs Pf values, which are calculated via
the real time data recorded during the earthquake in order
to determine probability of failure of the ﬁeld components.
The method minimizes the average expected restoration time
of the buses, and provides a restoration strategy. During the
modeling phase both the topological and electrical constraints
are considered, which yields an admissible result.
