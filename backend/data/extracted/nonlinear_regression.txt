Elementary Cellular Automata along with delay sensitivity can model communal riot
dynamics

(Dated: January 28, 2020)
This work explores the potential of elementary cellular automata to model the dynamics of riot.
Here, to model such dynamics, we introduce probabilistic loss of information and delay perturbation
in the updating scheme of automata to capture sociological parameters - presence of anti-riot popu-
lation and organizational presence of communal forces in the rioting society respectively. Moreover,
delay has also been incorporated in the model to capture the non-local interaction of neighbours.
Finally, the model is veriﬁed by a recent event of riot that occurred in Baduria of West Bengal,
India.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Riots and their dynamics have been a popular topic
to sociologists and historians [1–9]. In a parallel journey,
computer scientists and mathematicians have found their
interest in the study of riots, with a target to mathemat-
ically model their dynamics [10–19]. The most popular
approach of developing such models is to adopt epidemi-
ological framework [10–13, 17]. For example, 1960’s Los
Angeles (1965) - Detroit (1967) - Washington D.C. (1968)
riots [10], 2005 French riot [11], 2011 London riots [12]
etc. have been modelled using this approach. Recently,
non-local interactions along with neighbourhood depen-
dency of elements of the system have been introduced
in the models of riots [11, 13, 16, 20]. It is argued that
due to the globalization and the advent of communica-
tion technology, long range, that is, non-local commu-
nications among elements are necessary to better model
the dynamics of riots.
In this scenario, we undertake this research to show
that the elementary cellular automata (ECAs) which rely
only on local neighbourhood dependency can eﬃciently
model the dynamics of riots, if the neighbourhood de-
pendency is delay sensitive. In particular, to model riot
dynamics by ECAs, we introduce ‘probabilistic loss of in-
formation perturbation’ and ‘delay perturbation’ in the
updating scheme of the automata. We observe that due
to this updating scheme, the ECAs show a new kind of
dynamical behaviour, which suggests us that some ECAs
can be better model of riot. Finally, to validate our claim,
we take into consideration a recent riot that happened in
Baduria of West Bengal, India. Since media reports do
not always reﬂect the ground realities of riots, we orga-
nized an extensive ﬁeld study in Baduria to get insight

about rioting dynamics.
Here, in the proposed ECA based model, probabilistic
loss of information perturbation rate is related to socio-
logical factor such as the presence of anti-riot population
in the rioting society. Similarly, the presence of commu-
nal elements in society, which plays a role to regenerate
rioting spontaneity in the rioting society, indicates the
physical implication of delay in the system. However, the
inherent property of CA is local interaction which contra-
dicts the recent trends of considering non-locality in the
age of globalization [11, 13, 16, 20]. The delay passively
induces a non-locality in the environment. To illustrate,
the updated state information of a cell at time t reaches
to its neighbouring cell at t+n time step where n depicts
delay for the cell and its neighbouring cell. This implies,
non-local information from distance n reaches to the cor-
responding neighbouring cell. The presence of communal
organization in society, which physically indicates delay
in the system, induces this non-locality to regenerate the
rioting spontaneity.

DELAY SENSITIVE CELLULAR
AUTOMATA
Here, we work with simple one-dimensional three-
neighbouring two-state cellular automata, which are
commonly known as elementary cellular automata (ECA)
[21]. The next state of each CA cell is determined as St+1
i
= f(St
i−1,St
i ,St
i+1) where f is the next state function,
St
i−1,St
i,St
i+1 are the present states of left, self and right
neighbour of the i-th CA cell at time t, respectively. The
local transition function f: {0, 1}3 →{0, 1} can be ex-
pressed as eight arguments of f. The decimal counterpart
of eight next state is referred as ‘rule’. Each rule is asso-
ciated with a ‘decimal code’ w, where w =f(0, 0, 0).20 +
f(0, 0, 1).21 + · · · + f(1, 1, 1).27, for the naming purpose.
There are 28(256) ECA rules, out of which 88 are mini-
mal representative rules and the rest are their equivalent
[22]. Classically, all the cells of a CA are updated simul-
taneously. In the last decade, researchers have explored
dynamics of CA under asynchronous updating schemes
[23–30].
Classically, in ECA, delay and probabilistic loss of in-
2
formation during information sharing among the neigh-
bouring cells is not considered.
In traditional cellular
automata, if a cell updates its state at time t, then that
state information is available to neighbouring cell at time
t + 1. To deﬁne the delay involved in sharing of infor-
mation for two neighbouring cells i and j (i ̸= j), we
introduce a non-negative integer function D(i,j). In the
proposed system, D(i,j) = D(j,i) ⩾1 for any pair of
neighbouring cells i and j. To illustrate, D(i,j) = n in
the system implies, if cell i updates its state at time t,
then the updated state information is available to cell j
at time t + n. In the proposed system, the delays are
non-uniform in space; i.e. D(i,j) may be diﬀerent from
D(i′,j′), where i and j; i′ and j′ are neighbouring cells,
however, the delays are uniform in time. Practically, the
delay perturbation parameter d ∈N assigns the maxi-
mum possible delay in the proposed CA system. Every
pair of neighbouring cells are randomly initialized with
delay between 1 to d following a uniform distribution.
For the loss of information, one can consider that the
delay is ∞(inﬁnity). Here, ι (0 ≤ι ≤1) indicates the
probabilistic loss of information perturbation rate.
Now, for introducing probabilistic loss of information
and delay in the system, each cell has to maintain state
information of neighbours to get a view of neighbour’s
state. In the proposed system, each cell has a view about
the states of its neighbours which may change from time
to time depending on the arrival of state information
about neighbours. However, the cells act depending on
the current state information about neighbours at that
time. In this context, the state set is distinguished into
two parts - the actualstate (self) of a cell and a vec-
tor of neighbour’s viewstate. Now, the state set can be
written as S′ = S × S2. Therefore, for a cell c, conﬁgu-
ration at time t is distinguished into two parts - at
c and
vt
c where at
c ∈S is the actualstate and vt
c ∈S2 is the
vector of viewstate of left and right neighbours. Note
that, the actualstate set S is suﬃcient to represent tra-
ditional CA. Here, in the proposed CA system, the local
transition function is also sub-divided into two parts - in
the ﬁrst state update step, a cell changes its actualstate
depending on the actualstate of the self and viewstates of
neighbours; and, in the second information sharing step,
the cell shares its updated actualstate to its neighbouring
cells. Now, the local transition function can be written as
f ′ = fu◦fs, where, fu is the state update function, and fs
is the information-sharing function. Here, the operator
‘◦’ indicates that the functions are applied sequentially
to represent the actual update.
To illustrate, Fig 1 depicts a simple 3-cell ECA, where
D(i-1,i) = D(i+1,i-1) = 1 and D(i,i+1) = 2. In Fig. 1,
each cell has a view about the states of neighbours, i.e.
left and right one for each cell. For every time step, the
ﬁrst step (dotted line) shows the state update function
and the second step (straight line) shows the informa-
tion sharing function. Here, the information about state
change of cell i (resp. cell i+1) at ﬁrst time step reaches
to cell i+1 (resp. cell i) at third time step due to de-

lay perturbation. In Fig 1, the information about state
change of cell i at ﬁrst time step does not reach to cell
i-1 at second time step due to probabilistic loss of infor-
mation perturbation.
To sum up, the proposed CA system depends on the
following two parameters : (i) The delay perturbation
parameter d ∈N indicates the maximum delay limit of
the system; (ii) The probabilistic loss of information per-
turbation rate ι (0 ≤ι ≤1) indicates the probabilistic
loss of information during information sharing.

MODELING OF RIOTS
A.
Dynamic behaviour
To model the riot dynamics, we investigates the gen-
erative behaviour of the proposed ECA system. During
this study, we start with the smallest possible seed pat-
tern as initial conﬁguration where a single cell is in state
1, i.e. ⟨· · · 0001000 · · ·⟩. From modelling and theoreti-
cal research point of view, investigating dynamics of seed
patterns starting with single cell in state 1 is well estab-
lish research approach [31–33]. From the physical impli-
cation point of view, the initial seed with a single cell in
state 1 represents the triggering event of riots.
Here, we study the qualitative behaviour of the system
starting from a single seed where we need to look at the
evolution of the conﬁguration, i.e. space-time diagrams,
by inspection over a few time steps. Though this is not
a formal method, but this approach can provide a good
comparison. Note that, this generative behaviour study
does not include 29 odd ECAs, out of 88 minimum rep-
resentative ECAs, which have local transition function
f(0, 0, 0) = 1. For odd ECAs, an empty background con-
ﬁguration, i.e. · · · 000 · · ·, evolves to · · · 111 · · · which is
unable to produce the generative behaviour of the sys-
tem. Therefore, for even 59 rules, ECA depicts following
behaviours - (i) Evolution to zero: after one time step,
the seed cell in state 1 has vanished; (ii) Constant evolu-
tion: the initial seed remains unchanged during the evo-
lution of the system; (iii) Left evolution: the seed shifts
or grows in the left side; (iv) Right evolution: the seed

shifts or grows in the right; (v) Growth behaviour: the
seed cell develops into a pattern for both left and right
side. Fig. 2 depicts left evolution for ECA 14, right evo-
lution for ECA 60 and growth behaviour for ECA 30.

TABLE I. Classiﬁcation of ECA rules depending on the gen-
erative behaviour.
Here, the target of this simple classiﬁcation is to iden-
tify the ECAs which develop into a pattern for both left
and right side, i.e. growth behaviour. Here, we make
a sensible simple assumption that the riot propagation
aﬀects every neighbour, i.e. both left and right for ECA.
Therefore, 12 ECAs, out of 88, with growth behaviour are
our target for modelling riot dynamics. In this context,
note that, Redeker et. al. [31] classiﬁes the behaviour
of traditional synchronous CA starting from a single
seed into - ‘evolution to zero’,‘ﬁnite growth’,‘periodic
patterns’,‘Sierpi`nski patterns’ and ‘complex behaviour’
which have no clear equivalence to Wolfram’s classes [34].
‘Evolution to zero’ class only shows similarity with this
study. Here, the stable structure gets quickly destroyed
in the presence of delay and probabilistic loss of informa-
tion perturbation. As an evidence, in Fig. 2, fractal-like
Sierpi`nski patterns [31] are destroyed for ECA 18 under
the proposed system. Therefore, now, the target of this
study is to identify candidate ECAs from 12 growth be-
haviour ECAs to model the riot dynamics.
B.
Candidate ECAs for modelling riots
Let us assume that the riot dynamics has two phases
- spreading phase and diminishing phase. So, we choose
4 candidate ECAs, out of 12, which show phase transi-
tion under the proposed updating scheme, to model the
riot dynamics (as an example, see ECA 18 in Fig 2).
For these four ECAs 18, 26, 50 and 146, out of 88 min-
imal representative rules, there exists a critical value of
4
FIG. 3. The samples of space time diagrams depicting phase
transition - (left) d = 1, ι = 0.3; (middle) d = 1, ι = 0.4;
(right) d = 1, ι = 0.5.
probabilistic loss of information perturbation rate which
distinguishes the behaviour of the system in two diﬀer-
ent phases - passive phase (i.e. the system converges to a
homogeneous ﬁxed point of all 0’s) and active phase (i.e.
the system oscillates around a non-zero density). As an
example for ECA 50, Fig. 3(left) depicts the active phase
for probabilistic loss of information perturbation rate 0.3
(ι = 0.3), however, a phase transition from active to pas-
sive phase is observed in Fig. 3(right) where ι = 0.5. As
physical implication with respect to rioting dynamics, the
diminishing phase is not observed without the presence
of certain percentage of anti-riot population, i.e. prob-
abilistic loss of information perturbation rate. However,
presence of certain percentage of anti-riot population in
the society leads to passive phase in the diminishing riot-
ing dynamics. According to [24],this phase transition be-
longs to the directed percolation universality class. Note
that, in the literature of rioting dynamics research, the
idea of critical threshold was also discussed in [13, 35] for
understanding level of social tension to start a riot and
suﬃciently large number of protests to start a revolution
respectively.

Now, to understand the quantitative behaviour of these
candidate rules, we let the system evolve through 2000
time steps and average the density parameter value for
100 time steps. Note that, for a conﬁguration x ∈SL,
the density can be deﬁned as d(x) = #1x/|x|, where #1x
is the number of 1’s in the actualstate for the conﬁgura-
tion and |x| is the size of the conﬁguration. Fig. 4 shows
the plot of the proﬁle of density parameter starting from
a single ‘1’ seed as a function of the probabilistic loss of
information perturbation rate with a ﬁxed d parameter
for ECA rules which depicts phase transition behaviour.
Table II depicts the critical value of probabilistic loss of
information perturbation rate for phase transition asso-
ciated with these ECA rules where ιc
d=k indicates the
critical value with d parameter value k. Note that, the
critical value for phase transition increases when the up-
dating scheme is also associated with delay perturbation,
see Table II for evidence. Moreover, the critical value
of probabilistic loss of information perturbation rate for
phase transition proportionally increases with increasing
value of delay.
Table II justiﬁes that the diminishing
phase of riot needs more percentage of anti-riot popu-
lation in the presence of sociological factor delay. Note
that, this phase transition result is not observed for only
delay perturbation updating scheme. To sum up, ECAs
18,26,50,146 are the ﬁnal candidate rules for modelling ri-
oting dynamics. Therefore, now, the target is to identify
the best candidate rule among those ECAs for valida-
tion of Baduria riot dynamics. In this scenario, the next
section depicts the case study comprising Baduria riot’s
dataset.
IV.
BADURIA RIOT AND THE PROPOSED
SYSTEM
A.
Baduria riot dataset
Attracting nationwide media attention, Baduria riot is
the most well-exposed among recent Bengal’s riot events
[36, 37]. The triggering event of Baduria riot took place
after a social media religious post by a 17-year old student
in a village Baduria of West Bengal on 2nd July, 2017.
This social media post was seen as objectionable and
went viral in Baduria. Starting with this, violent clashes
were triggered between the two communities of Baduria,
Basirhat, Swarupnagar, Deganga, Taki and Haroa sub-
division.
Here, we base our analysis here on reported incidents
in media reports during Baduria rioting time. The au-
thenticity of media report data is cross veriﬁed with ﬁeld
study. We extract riot like events, as examples ‘attack
on police vehicles’, ‘serious injuries’, ‘group clashed’ etc.,
from 20 media reports [38–57] to build the data set. In
the literature, the traditional methodology for quantify-
ing the rioting activity is to study the daily crime reports
of police data for analysing the riot dynamics [11, 12].
However, this methodology suﬀers due to lack of data on
rioting event geographically located in third-world coun-

try. Note that, arrest records, though available, do not
indicate communal riot as explicit reason for the arrest.
Here, we adopt two simple methodology for quantify-
ing the rioting activity: Firstly, we deﬁne as a single event
any rioting-like act, as listed in the media reports after
ambiguity checking, depending on its intensity.
Thus,
‘rail blockades at 3 places’ counts as 3 events, ‘three
police vehicles have been torched’ indicates 3 riot like
events. We thus get a dataset composed of number of
riot like events for every day from July 2 to July 9, 2017.
Secondly, we quantify rioting activity from area (by sq.
km.) aﬀected by riot on a day to day basis from media
reports. Fig. 5 reﬂects the spatial propagation of riot dy-
namics. It is not possible to quantify some important riot
events, like (number of) group clashes, road blockades,
market/shop/school closure, from media reports. There-
fore, we quantify those rioting events by area aﬀected in
riots day-wise. Figure 6 shows number of attack events
on (a) police (vehicles, stations, persons); (b) religious
place, home, rail line and serious injuries; (c) aﬀected
area (in sq. km.) over the of time course.
Now, we calculate the summation of percentage of in-
tensity per rioting day, out of total intensity, for the ri-
oting event datasets of Fig. 6(a),(b),(c). Hereafter, the
percentage of intensity per rioting day of this summa-
rized intensity indicates the normalized overall intensity
of Baduria riot which is reﬂected in Figure 6(d). Here,
we work with this normalized overall intensity to under-
stand rioting dynamics, which shows simple growth (up)
and shrink (down) dynamics. Note that, this simple up
and down dynamics, without any rebound, was also ob-
served for 2005 French riots [11] and US ethnic riots [10].
With a contradiction, the dynamics with up and sudden
down (i.e. rise for four days and suddenly down on ﬁfth
day) was found in 2011 London riots [12, 13].
On a diﬀerent internal dynamics perspective, the prop-
agation dynamics of Baduria riot depends on the local
communication of violent events [58] and local rumour
propagation [59], [60]. However, during the riot event a
parallel journey of religious harmony is also reported in
media [39, 40] which ﬁnally converted the dynamics of
the event as an early diminishing riot event. The ﬁeld
data also reﬂects this evidence [61], [62].
In this context, anti-riot population of society does not
participate in this rumour propagation. Moreover, they
play an important role in the early diminishing dynamics
of the riots. Here, the term ‘anti-riot’ population is com-
posed of following population - ﬁrstly, the secular pop-
ulation of society [39, 40]; secondly, not ‘purely’ secular
population, however, due to the economical dependency
they play an anti-riot role during the riot time [63].
B.
Veriﬁcation
Now, this ﬁnding is mapped with the best candidate
rule among ECA 18, 26, 50, 146 for modelling the Baduria
rioting dynamics.
To compare the CA dynamics and
Baduria riot dynamics, here, we let the system evolve
starting from a single state ‘1’ seed and average the den-
sity parameter value for every 100 time steps which de-

ﬁnes one single time unit (∴1 time step ≈15 minute).
Therefore, the normalized density parameter and normal-
ized overall intensity of Baduria riot are the parameters
for comparison in this study. Note that, normalized den-
sity parameter is also calculated following the similar
procedure of calculating normalized overall intensity pa-
rameter. Fig. 7 shows the proﬁle of normalized density
parameter or normalized overall intensity of Baduria riot
as a function of the time series.
According to Fig. 7,
ECAs 26 and 146 show similar dynamics with Baduria
riot, however, ECAs 18 and 50 come up with ‘late’ con-
vergence dynamics for critical probabilistic loss of infor-
mation perturbation rate (ιc) where d = 1.
We iden-
tiﬁed the best ﬁtting CA model using the standard root
mean square deviation =
sPT
t=1(x1,t −x2,t)2
T
where x1,t
and x2,t depict the time series normalized overall inten-
sity of Baduria riots and density parameter value of CA
model respectively. Here, ECA 26 (d = 1 and ιc = .51)
shows the best ﬁtting attitude with Baduria riot data
where the root mean square deviation = 0.064.
Note
that, ECA 18, 50 and 146 are associated with root mean
square derivation value 0.129, 0.138 and 0.071 respec-
tively. The best ﬁtting CA with d = 1 depicts the evi-
dence of no major presence of organized communal force
in the rioting society. Note that, the ﬁeld data also re-
ﬂects this absence. Fig. 8 depicts the evidence associated
with ‘late’ convergence with increasing value of delay per-
turbation parameter for these ECA rules. Without pres-
ence of organized communal force, the rioting society re-
acts spontaneously and a simple up and down dynamics
is reﬂected. However, increasing rebound dynamics is ob-
served for increasing value of delay perturbation param-
eter, see Fig. 8 as evidence. As an insight, the rebound
dynamics indicates that organized communal force plays
role for regenerating the spontaneity of rioting in the so-
ciety.
The proposed model only veriﬁes rioting dynamics of
West Bengal event. However, as a discussion, ECA 146
depicts similar sudden-down dynamics of 2011 London ri-
ots [12], for evidence see Fig. 8. Moreover, Berestycki et.
al [13] have analysed sudden spike dynamics to represent
FIG. 7.
The plot compares normalized overall intensity of
Baduria riot and normalized density of ECA rules as a func-
tion of time series. Here, d = 1 and ι = ιc.
strong exogenous factor and slower but steady increase
to reﬂect endogenous factors in rioting dynamics. In this
context, ECA 18 and 50 shows similar sudden spike and
steady growth dynamics respectively, see Fig. 8 for evi-
dence. However, proper understanding about this simi-
lar signature behaviour of the proposed CA system and
exogenous-endogenous factors is still an open question
for us. Now, depending on the wide variety of results,
the study strongly indicates that this model is relevant
for other rioting dynamics.
To sumup, the study reﬂects the modelling aspects of
the internal convergence rioting dynamics with respect to
the sociological factors - presence of anti-riot population
as well as organizational presence of communal forces.
One may argue about the presence of other sociological
factors in the rioting dynamics, however, our target is to
propose a simple model which can able to capture the
complex rioting dynamics. To validate our argument, we
quote from Burbeck et al. [10] which is the pioneering
work on epidemiological mathematical riot modelling.
“First eﬀorts at model building in a new ﬁeld
necessarily encounter the risk of oversimpliﬁ-
cation, yet if the models are not kept as simple

rules. Here, the plot works with critical probabilistic loss of information perturbation rate ιc.
as is practical they tend to become immune to
falsiﬁcation.[10]”
Moreover, this simple local interaction model can be able
to capture non-locality using delay perturbation. Here,
the proposed CA system introduces non-uniformity with
respect to information sharing aspects, however, the sys-
tem is associated with uniform rule. Several non-uniform
internal dynamics are also reﬂected in Baduria incident,
i.e. here, three types of internal dynamics (ﬁrst: loot-
ing incident [64]; second: local resident vs refugees [65];
third: local people vs police [66]) are reﬂected from the
ﬁeld data. The current construction of CA model with
uniform rule is unable to address this microscopic dynam-
ics. Therefore, this research can be extended to explore
the dynamics of the CA model with non-uniform rule.
In terms of dynamical systems, the model adopts time
varying system rather than linear time invariant system
in the journey towards full ﬂedged non-linear dynamics.

[58] In some village there were incidents of bike burning of
Hindu youth. On the spread of this news to some other
village, Muslim youths in that village were beaten up.
In this way of local communication the riot began to
spread. Name: Hindu Salesman; Address: Vill- Choto Ji-
rat, Basirhat; Interview date, time: 20th October, 2019,
1:30pm at Itinda Ghat(near Icchamati River).
[59] There were random rumours of attacks the madrasa or
temples in the nearby villages. These rumours were prop-
agating the riots. Name: Jallaluddin; Address: Bhabla
halt, Basirhat; Occupation: Cycle garage owner; Inter-
view date, time: 20th October, 2019, 3:00pm at Bhabla
halt Station (Muslim area).

such incidents. Name: Tapas Ghosh; Address: Paikpara,
Basirhat; Occupation: Shopkeeper; Interview date, time:
20th October, 2019, 4:00pm at Paikpara (Muslim area).
[61] As he said a sick Muslim-youth along with his old mother
were found sitting near the road. Out of riot fear, they
were clueless about what to do and how to reach home.
The Muslim-youth was discharged from hospital and was
seen carrying saline bottles along with him. The Hindu
salesman felt very sympathetic towards the Muslim-
youth, he took the Muslim-youth to his house to provide
him shelter. Due to this attitude the Hindu-neighbour of
the Hindu-salesman at ﬁrst got angry but later on they
understood the situation. Name: Hindu Salesman; Ad-
dress: Vill- Choto Jirat, Basirhat; Interview date, time:
20th October, 2019, 1:30pm at Itinda Ghat(near Iccha-
mati River).

5000/- to a poor Hindu shopkeeper whose shop was
attacked. Name:
Tapas Ghosh;
Address:
Paikpara,
Basirhat; Occupation: Shopkeeper; Interview date, time:
20th October, 2019, 4:00pm at Paikpara (Muslim area).
[63] There exists a dependency of Hindu-Muslim in the area,
it is seen that Muslim workers work under Hindu owner
and vice-versa, and also seen that they work together
as workers, that is the main reason of early convergence
of the riot. Name: Sambhu Seth; Address: Trimohini,
Basirhat; Occupation: Owner of Private Eye Hospital;
Interview date, time: 20th October, 2019, 12:00pm.
[64] On 3rd and 4th day of July 2017 there was attack and loot
in the Hindu shops of the area, along with a small pan and
cigarette shop nearby. He claimed the loot was of 22lakhs
during the incident. Out of sorrow he expressed that the
small pan and cigarette shop received its reimbursement
whereas others including him did not receive. In the Tri-
mohini area the Hindu and Muslim shops are situated on
opposite sides of the main road, due to which it is easy
to identify the shops by their religion. In the evening
at around 8pm of 3rd July there was an attack in the
Rath Jatra at Trimohini which was followed by the loot
at mid-night. Following this incident there were attacks
and loots in the Muslim shops of the area on 5th July.

view date, time: 20th October, 2019, 3:00pm.
