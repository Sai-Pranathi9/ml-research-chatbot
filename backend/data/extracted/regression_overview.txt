From H¨older triangles to the whole plane
Sergio Alvarez
Abstract
We show how to determine whether two given real polynomial functions of a single
variable are Lipschitz equivalent by comparing the values and also the multiplicities of
the given polynomial functions at their critical points. Then we show how to reduce the
problem of R-semialgebraic Lipschitz classiﬁcation of β-quasihomogeneous polynomials
of two real variables to the problem of Lipschitz classiﬁcation of real polynomial functions
of a single variable, under some fairly general conditions.

Introduction
In [4], Henry and Parusi´nski showed that the bi-Lipschitz classiﬁcation of complex analytic
function germs admits continuous moduli. This fact had not been observed before and interest-
ingly it contrasts with the fact that the bi-Lipschitz equivalence of complex analytic set germs
does not admit moduli [7]. The moduli space of bi-Lipschitz equivalence is not yet completely
understood but it is worth noting that recently Cˆamara and Ruas have made progress in the
study of the moduli space of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of quasihomogeneous function germs, in
the complex case [2].
In [5], Henry and Parusi´nski showed that the bi-Lipschitz classiﬁcation of real analytic
function germs admits continuous moduli. The particular case of weighted homogeneous poly-
nomial functions of two real variables has been considered by Koike and Parusi´nski in [6]. Then,
independently, in [1], Birbrair, Fernandes and Panazzolo described the bi-Lipschitz moduli in
the “simplest possible case” (as they have called it): quasihomogeneous polynomial functions
deﬁned on the H¨older triangle Tβ := {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x, 0 ≤y ≤xβ}.
In this paper, we consider the problem of classifying β-quasihomogeneous polynomials in
two variables with real coeﬃcients modulo R-semialgebraic Lipschitz equivalence. Here and
throughout the text, β always denotes a rational number > 1. (We deﬁne β-quasihomogeneous
polynomials and R-semialgebraic Lipschitz equivalence in section 5.)
Our main goal is to
extend the results obtained in [1] for the classiﬁcation of germs of functions deﬁned on the
H¨older triangle to germs of functions deﬁned on the whole plane.
Following the strategy used in [1], we attack the problem by reducing it to the Lipschitz
classiﬁcation of real polynomial functions of a single variable. The classiﬁcation of polynomial
functions of a single variable is carried out in section 2. Here too, we follow the strategy used in
[1], which consists in comparing the values and also the multiplicities of the given polynomial
functions at their critical points.
In order to accomplish the reduction to the single variable case, still following the strategy
used in [1], we associate with each β-quasihomogeneous polynomial F(X, Y ) ∈R[X, Y ] a pair
of polynomial functions f+, f−: R →R, called the height functions of F, which encode a great
deal of information about the original polynomial. Then, we consider the following questions:
1
1. Suppose that two given β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F, G ∈R[X, Y ] of degree d ≥
1 are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent.
Is it possible to arrange their height
functions in pairs of Lipschitz equivalent functions?
2. Suppose that the height functions of two given β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F, G ∈
R[X, Y ] of degree d ≥1 can be arranged in pairs of Lipschitz equivalent functions. Are
F and G R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent?
We show that if the zero sets of the polynomials F and G have points both on the right
half-plane and on the left half-plane then the answer to the ﬁrst question is yes (Corollary
5). Also, we obtain some rather general conditions under which the answer to question 2 is
aﬃrmative (Theorem 2). These are the main results of the paper.
In [1], the questions stated above were both answered aﬃrmatively in the case where the
equivalence is restricted to the H¨older triangle Tβ, assuming that the given β-quasihomogeneous
polynomials vanish identically on ∂Tβ and do not vanish at the interior points of Tβ. Here, we
generalize the methods devised by Lev Birbrair, Alexandre Fernandes, and Daniel Panazzolo.
This generalization leads to the theory of β-transforms and inverse β-transforms presented in
sections 4, 6, and 7. In sections 5 and 9, we apply the general theory to obtain our main results.

Lipschitz equivalence of polynomial functions of a sin-
gle variable
Two nonzero polynomial functions f, g : R →R are Lipschitz equivalent, written f ∼= g, if there
exist a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism φ : R →R and a constant c > 0 such that
g ◦φ = cf.
(1)
In this section, we provide eﬀective criteria to determine whether any two nonzero polyno-
mial functions f, g : R →R are Lipschitz equivalent. Clearly, two nonzero constant functions
are Lipschitz equivalent if and only if they have the same sign; so we focus on nonconstant
polynomial functions. In this case, φ is necessarily semialgebraic (see [1, Lemma 3.1]).
Lemma 1. Let f, g : R →R be nonconstant polynomial functions. Suppose that f and g are
Lipschitz equivalent, so that g ◦φ = cf, for some bi-Lipschitz function φ : R →R and some
constant c > 0. We have:
i. deg f = deg g
ii. limt→+∞φ(t)/t = limt→−∞φ(t)/t
iii. 0 < lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)/t| < ∞
Proof. Let f(t) = Pd
i=0 aiti and g(t) = Pe
i=0 biti, where ad, be ̸= 0, and let
l+ := lim
t→+∞
φ(t)
t
and
l−:= lim
t→−∞
φ(t)
t .
These limits are both well-deﬁned in the extended real line because φ is semialgebraic. Also,
since φ is bi-Lipschitz, they are nonzero real numbers.
2
Since lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)| = +∞, we have
lim
|t|→+∞
g(φ(t))
φ(t)e
=
lim
|t|→+∞
g(t)
te
= be.
Then,
c · lim
t→+∞
f(t)
te
= lim
t→+∞
g(φ(t))
te
= lim
t→+∞
g(φ(t))
φ(t)e
· lim
t→+∞
φ(t)
t
e
= bele
+.
Since bele
+ is a nonzero real number, it follows that d = e (which proves (i)) and also that
c · ad = c · lim
t→+∞f(t)/td = bdld
+.
Similarly, we have:
c · ad = c · lim
t→−∞
f(t)
td
= lim
t→−∞
g(φ(t))
td
= lim
t→−∞
g(φ(t))
φ(t)d · lim
t→−∞
φ(t)
t
d
= bdld
−.
Thus, ld
+ = c · ad/bd = ld
−, which implies that |l+| = |l−|.
On the other hand, since φ is
monotonic and lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)| = +∞, either φ(t) and t have the same sign for large |t|, or φ(t)
and t have opposite signs for large |t|. In any case, l+ and l−have the same sign, and therefore
l+ = l−. This proves (ii) and ensures that the limit lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t is a well-deﬁned nonzero
real number. Hence, (iii) is also proved.
■
By Lemma 1, equality of degrees is a necessary condition for Lipschitz equivalence. Thus,
the problem of classifying polynomial functions modulo Lipschitz equivalence is reduced to the
classiﬁcation of nonconstant polynomial functions of the same degree.
Lemma 2. Let f, g : R →R be two polynomial functions of the same degree d ≥1, and suppose
that φ : R →R is a bijective function such that g ◦φ = cf, for some constant c > 0. The
following conditions are equivalent:
i. φ is bi-Lipschitz;
ii. The multiplicity of f at t is equal to the multiplicity of g at φ(t), for all t ∈R;
iii. φ is bi-analytic.
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii):
Pick any point t0 ∈R. Let k be the multiplicity of f at t0, and let l be the
multiplicity of g at φ(t0). For any pair of functions u, v : R →R, we write u ∼v to indicate
that there exist constants A, B > 0 such that A |v(t)| ≤|u(t)| ≤B |v(t)|, for t suﬃciently close
to t0. Then, f(t) −f(t0) ∼(t −t0)k and g(s) −g(φ(t0)) ∼(s −φ(t0))l. Since g ◦φ = cf, this
implies that (φ(t) −φ(t0))l ∼(t −t0)k. And since we are assumig that φ is bi-Lipschitz, it
follows that (t −t0)l ∼(t −t0)k. Therefore, k = l.
(ii) ⇒(iii):
Pick any point t0 ∈R. Suppose that ˆf := cf has multiplicity k at t0. Then,
there exist an increasing analytic diﬀeomorphism u : I →(−ǫ, ǫ), with t0 ∈I, and a constant
ρ ∈R\{0}, such that u(t0) = 0 and ˆf ◦u−1(t) = a+ρtk, for |t| < ǫ; where a := ˆf(t0) = g◦φ(t0).
Since we are assuming that condition (ii) holds, the multiplicity of g at the point φ(t0) is also
k. Then, as before, there exist an increasing analytic diﬀeomorphism v : J →(−ǫ′, ǫ′), with
φ(t0) ∈J, and a constant σ ∈R \ {0}, such that v(φ(t0)) = 0 and g ◦v−1(t) = a + σtk, for
|t| < ǫ′.
3
Shrinking the interval I, if necessary, we can assume that φ(I) ⊆J. Hence, we can write
ˆf ◦u−1(t) = g ◦v−1(¯φ(t)), where ¯φ := v ◦φ ◦u−1 : (−ǫ, ǫ) →(−ǫ′, ǫ′); and then it follows that
¯φ(t) = νt, where ν = ±
 ρ
σ

1
k , depending on whether φ is increasing (positive sign) or decreasing
(negative sign). In particular, this shows that ¯φ is analytic.
Therefore, φ|I = v−1 ◦¯φ◦u is analytic; so φ is analytic at t0. Since the point t0 ∈R is arbitrary,
it follows that φ is an analytic function. A similar argument, applied to φ−1, shows that φ−1 is
also analytic.
(iii) ⇒(i):
Suppose that φ is bi-analytic. Then, in particular, φ is a homeomorphism, so φ is
monotonic and lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)| = +∞. Also, since f, g are non-constant polynomial functions
and g ◦φ = cf, φ is a semialgebraic function (see [1, Lemma 3.1]).
Let f(t) = Pd
i=0 aiti and g(t) = Pd
i=0 biti, with ad, bd ̸= 0. Since g◦φ = cf and lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)| =
+∞, we have

φ(t)

φ(t)

(2)
Let l+ := limt→+∞φ(t)/t and l−:= limt→−∞φ(t)/t. Both of these limits are well-deﬁned in the
extended real line because φ is semialgebraic. It follows from equation (2) that we actually
have l+, l−∈R \ {0} and |l+| = |l−|. (Notice that to obtain this last equality from equation
(2), we use the fact that d > 0.)
By L’Hˆopital’s rule, limt→+∞φ′(t) = l+ and limt→−∞φ′(t) = l−. (The existence of these limits
in the extended real line is guaranteed by the fact that φ′ is semialgebraic, so L’Hˆopital’s
rule can be applied.) Thus, limt→+∞|φ′(t)| = limt→−∞|φ′(t)|; so that |φ′| can be continuously
extended to a positive function deﬁned on the compact space R ∪{∞} ∼= S1. Hence, there
exist constants A, B > 0 such that A ≤|φ′(t)| ≤B, for all t ∈R. Therefore, φ is bi-Lipschitz.
■
From the two lemmas above, it follows that if two polynomial functions f, g : R →R
are Lipschitz equivalent, then they have the same degree and they have the same number of
critical points. The ﬁrst assertion is immediate from Lemma 1. The second assertion follows
from Lemma 2: if φ : R →R is a bi-Lipschitz homemorphism such that g ◦φ = cf, for some
constant c > 0, then φ induces a 1-1 correpondence between the critical points of f and the
critical points of g, because it preserves multiplicity.
Propositions 1, 2, and 3 provide eﬀective criteria to determine whether any two noncon-
stant polynomial functions f, g : R →R, of the same degree, are Lipschitz equivalent.
In
Proposition 1, we consider the case in which f and g have no critical points; in Proposition 2,
the case in which both f and g have only one critical point; and in Proposition 3, the case in
which f and g have the same number k ≥2 of critical points.
Proposition 1. Let f, g : R →R be two polynomial functions of the same degree d ≥1. If f
and g have no critical points, then f and g are Lipschitz equivalent.
Proof. If f and g have no critical points, then they are both bi-analytic diﬀeomorphisms. Hence,
f = g◦φ, where φ := g−1◦f is a bi-analytic diﬀeomorphism. By Lemma 2, φ is bi-Lipschitz.
■
Proposition 2. Let f, g : R →R be two polynomial functions of the same degree d ≥1.
Suppose that f has only one critical point t0, with multiplicity k, and that g has only one
critical point s0, with the same multiplicity k. Also, suppose that f(t0) and g(s0) have the same
sign1(positive, negative or zero).
1Clearly, this is a necessary condition for f and g to be Lipschitz equivalent.
4
i. If d is odd, then f and g are Lipschitz equivalent;
ii. If d is even, then f and g are Lipschitz equivalent if and only if s0 and t0 are either both
minimum points, or both maximum points of f and g, respectively.
Proof. First, consider the case where d is odd. If a real polynomial function of a single variable,
of odd degree, has only one critical point, then it is a homeomorphism.
Thus, under the
assumption that d is odd, f and g are homeomorphisms. Choose a constant c > 0 such that
g(s0) = cf(t0), and deﬁne φ := g−1 ◦ˆf : R →R, where ˆf := cf. The function φ is a bijection
satisfying (1), and the multiplicity of f at t is equal to the multiplicity of g at φ(t) for all t ∈R.
By Lemma 2, φ is bi-Lipschitz.
Now, suppose that d is even. If a real polynomial function of a single variable, of even
degree, has only one critical point, then this critical point is a point of local extremum (and
consequently it is a point of even multiplicity). If f and g are Lipschitz equivalent, then t0 and
s0 are either both minimum points or both maximum points of f and g, respectively. Otherwise,
we would have ˆf(R) ∩g(R) = { ˆf(t0)} = {g(s0)}, which is absurd, since equation (1) implies
that ˆf(R) = g(R). Conversely, suppose that t0 and s0 are either both minimum points or both
maximum points of f and g, respectively. Pick any constant c > 0 for which g(s0) = cf(t0),
and deﬁne φ : R →R by
φ|(−∞,t0] :=
 g|(−∞,s0]
−1 ◦ˆf|(−∞,t0],
φ|[t0,+∞) :=
 g|[s0,+∞)
−1 ◦ˆf|[t0,+∞).
Clearly, φ is a bijection satisfying (1), and the multiplicity of f at t is equal to the
multiplicity of g at φ(t) for all t ∈R. Again, by Lemma 2, φ is bi-Lipschitz.
■
For the case in which f and g have the same number p ≥2 of critical points, we introduce
an adapted version of the notion of multiplicity symbol deﬁned in [1].
Let f : R →R be a polynomial function of degree d ≥1, having exactly p critical
points, with p ≥2. Let t1 < . . . < tp be the critical points of f, with multiplicities µ1, . . . , µp,
respectively. The multiplicity symbol of f is the ordered pair (a, µ) whose ﬁrst entry is the
p-tuple a = (f(t1), . . . , f(tp)), and second entry is the p-tuple µ = (µ1, . . . , µp).
Let g : R →R be another polynomial function of degree d ≥1, having exactly the
same number p ≥2 of critical points. Let s1 < . . . < sp be the critical points of g, with
multiplicities ν1, . . . , νp, respectively. The multiplicity symbol of g is the ordered pair (b, ν),
where b = (g(s1), . . . , g(sp)) and ν = (ν1, . . . , νp).
The multiplicity symbols (a, µ) and (b, ν) are said to be:
i. directly similar, if there exists a constant c > 0 such that b = c · a, and ν = µ;
ii. reversely similar, if there exists a constant c > 0 such that b = c · a, and ν = µ.
For any p-tuple x = (x1, . . . , xp), x := (xp, . . . , x1) is the p-tuple x written in reverse order.
The multiplicity symbols (a, µ) and (b, ν) are said to be similar if they are either directly
similar or reversely similar.
Proposition 3. Let f, g : R →R be two polynomial functions of the same degree d ≥1 having
the same number p ≥2 of critical points. Then, f and g are Lipschitz equivalent if and only if
their multiplicity symbols are similar.
5
Proof. First, suppose that f and g are Lipschitz equivalent. Then there exist a bi-Lipschitz
function φ : R →R and a constant c > 0 such that g ◦φ = cf. Let t1, . . . , tp be the critical
points of f, with multiplicities µ1, . . . , µp, and let s1, . . . , sp be the critical points of g, with
multiplicities ν1, . . . , νp. (As we noted just after the proof of Lemma 2, Lipschitz equivalent
polynomials have the same number of critical points.) Let (a, µ) be the multiplicity symbol of
f and (b, ν) the multiplicity symbol of g.
By Lemma 2, φ preserves multiplicities. Thus, if φ is increasing, then we have φ(ti) = si
and µi = νi, for i = 1, . . . , p. Since g ◦φ = cf, it follows that also bi = g(si) = c · f(ti) = c · ai,
for i = 1, . . . , p. Hence, if φ is increasing then the multiplicity symbols of f and g are directly
similar. On the other hand, if φ is decreasing, then we have φ(tp+1−i) = si and µp+1−i = νi,
for i = 1, . . . , p. Since g ◦φ = cf, it follows that also bi = g(si) = c · f(tp+1−i) = c · ap+1−i, for
i = 1, . . . , p. Hence, if φ is decreasing then the multiplicity symbols of f and g are reversely
similar. In any case, it follows that the multiplicity symbols of f and g are similar.
Now we prove the converse. Suppose that the multiplicity symbols of f and g are similar.
Replacing g with g ◦α, where α := −id : R →R (which is bi-Lipschitz), we can assume that
the multiplicity symbols of f and g are directly similar.
Let t1 < . . . < tp be the critical points of f, with multiplicities µ1, . . . , µp, respectively;
and let s1 < . . . < sp be the critical points of g, with multiplicities ν1, . . . , νp, respectively.
Since we are assuming that the multiplicity symbols of f and g are directly similar, there exists
a constant c > 0 such that g(si) = cf(ti), for i = 1, . . . , p; and µi = νi, for i = 1, . . . , p.
Let ˆf := cf and ci := g(si) = ˆf(ti). (Notice that ci ̸= ci+1, for 1
≤
i
<
k.) The
functions ˆf|[ti,ti+1] : [ti, ti+1] →[ci, ci+1] and g|[si,si+1] : [si, si+1] →[ci, ci+1] are both monotonic
and injective. The same is true for the functions ˆf|(−∞,t1] and g|(−∞,s1], and also for the functions
ˆf|[tp,+∞) and g|[sp,+∞).
Moreover, the functions ˆf|(−∞,t1] and g|(−∞,s1] are either both increasing or both decreasing
because ˆf(t1) = g(s1), ˆf(t2) = g(s2), and µ1 = ν1. Since ˆf(t1) = g(s1) and
 ˆf(t)
 , |g(t)| →+∞,
as |t| →+∞, this implies that ˆf((−∞, t1]) = g((−∞, s1]).
Similarly, the functions ˆf|[tp,+∞) and g|[sp,+∞) are either both increasing or both de-
creasing because ˆf(tp−1) = g(sp−1), ˆf(tp) = g(sp), and µp = νp. Since ˆf(tp) = g(sp), and
 ˆf(t)
 , |g(t)| →+∞, as |t| →+∞, this implies that ˆf([tp, +∞)) = g([sp, +∞)).
Deﬁne φ : R →R by
φ|(−∞,t1] :=
 g|(−∞,s1]
−1 ◦ˆf|(−∞,t1]
φ|[ti,ti+1] :=
 g|[si,si+1]
−1 ◦ˆf|[ti,ti+1], for 1 ≤i < p
φ|[tp,+∞) :=
 g|[sp,+∞)
−1 ◦ˆf|[tp,+∞)
Clearly, φ is a bijection satisfying (1), and it takes ti to si, for i = 1, . . . , p. Since the
multiplicity symbols of f and g are directly similar, it follows that the multiplicity of f at t is
equal to the multiplicity of g at φ(t) for all t ∈R. By Lemma 2, φ is bi-Lipschitz.

Transformation of paths by Lipschitz maps
In this section, we state and prove some results that will be used in the sequel.
6
Lemma 3. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic Lipschitz map, let γ : [0, ǫ) →
R2 be a continuous semialgebraic path such that γ(0) = 0, and let ˜γ(t) := Φ(γ(t)). If γ has
ﬁnite initial velocity then ˜γ also has ﬁnite initial velocity, that is, if limt→0+ |γ(t)/t| < ∞then
limt→0+ |˜γ(t)/t| < ∞.
Proof. Since Φ is Lipschitz and Φ(0) = 0, there exists K > 0 such that |Φ(x, y)| ≤K |(x, y)|.
Then,

˜γ(t)
t
 =

Φ(γ(t))
t
 ≤K

γ(t)
t
 ,
which implies that ˜γ′
+(0) is ﬁnite, given that γ′
+(0) is ﬁnite, by hypothesis.
■
Lemma 4. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic Lipschitz map. Let γ1, γ2 :
[0, ǫ) →R2 be two continuous semialgebraic paths, with ﬁnite initial velocity, such that γ1(0) =
γ2(0) = 0, and let ˜γi(t) := Φ(γi(t)), i = 1, 2. If γ′
1+(0) = γ′
2+(0), then ˜γ′
1+(0) = ˜γ′
2+(0).
Proof. Since Φ is Lipschitz and Φ(0) = 0, there exists K > 0 such that |Φ(x, y)| ≤K |(x, y)|.
Since |˜γ1(t) −˜γ2(t)| ≤K |γ1(t) −γ2(t)|, we have:

˜γ1(t)
t
−˜γ2(t)
t
 ≤K

γ1(t)
t
−γ2(t)
t
 ,
for t > 0.
Also, from limt→0+ γi(t)/t = γ′
i+(0) and γ′
1+(0) = γ′
2+(0), we see that
lim
t→0+

γ1(t)
t
−γ2(t)
t
 = 0,
since both γ1 and γ2 have ﬁnite initial velocity.
Then, by the Squeeze Theorem,
lim
t→0+

˜γ1(t)
t
−˜γ2(t)
t
 = 0.
By Lemma 3, both ˜γ1 and ˜γ2 have ﬁnite initial velocity, so it follows that ˜γ′
1+(0) = ˜γ′
2+(0).
■
Corollary 1. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic Lipschitz map, let γ1, γ2 :
[0, ǫ) →R2 be two continuous semialgebraic paths, with ﬁnite initial velocity, such that γ1(0) =
γ2(0) = 0, and let ˜γi(t) := Φ(γi(t)), i = 1, 2. If γ′
2+(0) = c · γ′
1+(0), with c > 0, then ˜γ′
2+(0) =
c · ˜γ′
1+(0).
Proof. Consider the path γ0(t) := γ1(ct), 0 ≤t < ǫ/c, and let ˜γ0(t) := Φ(γ0(t)). By Lemma
4, since γ′
0+(0) = cγ′
1+(0) = γ′
2+(0), we have ˜γ′
0+(0) = ˜γ′
2+(0). On the other hand, ˜γ0(t) =
Φ(γ0(t)) = Φ(γ1(ct)) = ˜γ1(ct), so ˜γ′
0+(0) = c˜γ′
1+(0). Hence, ˜γ′
2+(0) = c · ˜γ′
1+(0).
■
Corollary 2. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz map.
Let
γ1, γ2 : [0, ǫ) →R2 be two continuous semialgebraic paths, with ﬁnite initial velocity, such that
γ1(0) = γ2(0) = 0, and let ˜γi(t) := Φ(γi(t)), i = 1, 2. The initial velocities of the paths γ1 and
γ2 have the same direction if and only if the initial velocities of the paths ˜γ1 and ˜γ2 have the
same direction.

β-isomorphisms and the β-transform
A germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz map Φ = (Φ1, Φ2) : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) is said to be a
β-isomorphism of degree d ≥1 if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
i. There exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) of degree d such that
G ◦Φ = F.
ii. limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0 and limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0
When there is no danger of confusion, we shall simply say β-isomorphism, omitting the reference
to the degree d, which is always assumed to be ≥1.
Remark 1. For any germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0),
the path Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, has ﬁnite non-zero initial velocity.
In fact, it is immediate from Lemma 3 that the path Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, has ﬁnite initial
velocity. On the other hand, there exists A > 0 such that Φ(x, 0) ≥A |x|, because Φ is bi-
Lipschitz and Φ(0) = 0; so we have |Φ(x, 0)/x| ≥A, for x ̸= 0. Hence, limx→0+ Φ(x, 0)/x ̸= 0.
Similarly, we can prove that the path Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, also has ﬁnite non-zero initial
velocity.
Remark 2. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be any germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz map. It is
immediate from Lemma 4 that for all t ∈R, we have:
i. The initial velocity of the path Φ(x, txβ), 0 ≤x < ǫ, is equal to the initial velocity of the
path Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ.
ii. The initial velocity of the path Φ(−x, txβ), 0 ≤x < ǫ, is equal to the initial velocity of
the path Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ.
Hence, for all t ∈R,
lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, txβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, 0)
x
and
lim
x→0+
Φ1(−x, txβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ1(−x, 0)
x
.
(3)
Also, for all t ∈R,
lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, txβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, 0)
x
and
lim
x→0+
Φ2(−x, txβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ2(−x, 0)
x
.

Proposition 4. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz homeo-
morphism. Suppose that there exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) of
degree d ≥1 such that G ◦Φ = F. We have:
i. If Φ is a β-isomorphism then, for each t ∈R, Φ2(x, t |x|β) = O(|x|β) as x →0.
ii. If there exist t0, t1 ∈R such that
Φ2(x, t0 |x|β) = O(|x|β) as x →0+
and
Φ2(x, t1 |x|β) = O(|x|β) as x →0−,
then Φ is a β-isomorphism.
8
Proof. Suppose that Φ is a β-isomorphism. Let β = r/s, with r > s > 0, and gcd(r, s) = 1.
Then we have
G(X, Y ) =
m
X
k=0
ckXd−rkY sk,
where the coeﬃcients ck are real numbers, cm ̸= 0, and m ≤⌊d/r⌋.
By hypothesis, G(Φ(x, y)) = F(x, y). Thus, for any t ∈R and x ̸= 0 suﬃciently small,
G(Φ(x, t |x|β)) = F(x, t |x|β) .
Since the polynomials F and G are β-quasihomogeneous, this implies that
G
 
Φ1(x, t |x|β)

!
= f(t),
where
f(t) =
(
F(1, t),
if x > 0
F(−1, t),
if x < 0 .
Hence, for each t ∈R and x ̸= 0 suﬃciently small, y = Φ2(x, t |x|β)/ |x|β is a zero of the
nonconstant polynomial
Ht,x(y) := G(˜x, y) −f(t) ∈R[y],
where ˜x := Φ1(x, t |x|β)/ |x|. Applying Cauchy’s bound on the roots of a polynomial, we obtain

Since Φ is a β-isomorphism, we have
lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, 0)
x
̸= 0
and
lim
x→0+
Φ1(−x, 0)
x
̸= 0
Then, by equation (3), we obtain
lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, t |x|β)
|x|
̸= 0
and
lim
x→0−
Φ1(x, t |x|β)
|x|
̸= 0,
for all t ∈R.
(6)
From (5) and (6), it follows that, for each t ∈R, Φ2(x, t |x|β)/ |x|β is bounded for x ̸= 0
suﬃciently small. This proves (i).
Now, suppose that for certain t0, t1 ∈R, Φ2(x, t0 |x|β)/ |x|β is bounded for x > 0 suﬃ-
ciently small, and Φ2(x, t1 |x|β)/ |x|β is bounded for x < 0 suﬃciently small. Then
lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, t0xβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, t0xβ)
xβ
· xβ−1 = 0
and
lim
x→0+
Φ2(−x, t1xβ)
x
= lim
x→0+
Φ2(−x, t1xβ)
xβ
· xβ−1 = 0
Thus, by (4),
lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, 0)
x
= 0
and
lim
x→0+
Φ2(−x, 0)
x
= 0 .
9
On the other hand, by Remark 1, the paths Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, and Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ,
both have (ﬁnite) non-zero initial velocity. Hence,
lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, 0)
x
̸= 0
and
lim
x→0+
Φ1(−x, 0)
x
̸= 0 .
Therefore, Φ is a β-isomorphism.
■
Proposition 5. If Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) is a β-isomorphism then the initial velocities of the
paths Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, and Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, are horizontal 2 and have opposite directions.
Proof. Let Φ be a β-isomorphism. By Proposition 4, we have Φ2(x, 0) = O(|x|β) as x →0.
Then, limx→0+ Φ2(x, 0)/x = limx→0+ Φ2(−x, 0)/x = 0. Since the paths Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ,
and Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, both have nonzero ﬁnite initial velocity (Remark 1), it follows that
both of them have horizontal initial velocity. By Corollary 2, the initial velocities of the paths
Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, and Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, do not have the same direction. Since they are
both horizontal, they have opposite directions.
■
It follows from Proposition 5 that each β-isomorphism Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) satisﬁes one
of the following conditions:
(A) limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x > 0 and limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x > 0
(B) limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x < 0 and limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x < 0
A β-isomorphism Φ is said to be direct if it satisﬁes (A), and it is said to be reverse if it
satisﬁes (B).
Proposition 6. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz homeomor-
phism. Suppose that there exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) of the
same degree d ≥1 such that G ◦Φ = F. The following assertions are equivalent:
i. Φ is a β-isomorphism
ii. For any continuous semialgebraic path γ : [0, ǫ) →R2, if the initial velocity of γ is
horizontal, then the initial velocity of ˜γ := Φ ◦γ is horizontal.
Proof. First, we prove that (i) ⇒(ii). Suppose that Φ is a β-isomorphism.
Take any continuous semialgebraic path γ : [0, ǫ) →R2 whose initial velocity is horizontal.
Since the initial velocities of the paths α+, α−: [0, ǫ) →R2, given by α+(t) = (t, 0) and
α−(t) = (−t, 0), are both horizontal and have opposite directions, the initial velocity of γ has
either the same direction as the initial velocity of α+, or the same direction as the initial velocity
of α−.
By Corollary 2, this implies that the initial velocity of ˜γ := Φ ◦γ has either the same
direction as the initial velocity of ˜α+ := Φ ◦α+, or the same direction as the initial velocity
of ˜α−:= Φ ◦α−. In any case, the initial velocity of ˜γ is horizontal: by Proposition 5, the
initial velocities of ˜α+ and ˜α−are both horizontal (and have opposite directions) because Φ is
a β-isomorphism.
Now, we prove that (ii) ⇒(i). Assume that condition (ii) is satisﬁed. We show that
limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0 and limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0.
2We say that a vector (v1, v2) ∈R2 is horizontal if v1 ̸= 0 and v2 = 0.
10
Since the initial velocity of the path α+ is horizontal, it follows from our assumption that
the initial velocity of the path ˜α+ = Φ ◦α+ is horizontal. Hence, limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0.
Similarly, since the initial velocity of the path α−is horizontal, it follows from our assumption
that the initial velocity of the path ˜α−= Φ◦α−is horizontal. Hence, limx→0+ Φ1(−x, 0)/x ̸= 0.
And since limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x = −limx→0+ Φ1(−x, 0)/x, we have limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x ̸= 0.
■
Let Φ and Ψ be β-isomorphisms of degree d. We say that Ψ is composable with Φ if there
exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ), G(X, Y ), H(X, Y ) of the degree d such that
H ◦Ψ = G and G ◦Φ = F.
Proposition 7. Let Φ, Ψ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be β-isomorphisms of degree d. If Ψ is composable
with Φ, then Ψ ◦Φ is a β-isomorphism of degree d.
Proof. Suppose that Ψ is composable with Φ. Then, there exist β-quasihomogeneous polyno-
mials F(X, Y ), G(X, Y ), H(X, Y ) of the same degree d ≥1 such that H ◦Ψ = G and G◦Φ = F,
so H ◦(Ψ◦Φ) = F. Now, take any continuous semialgebraic path γ : [0, ǫ) →R2 with horizontal
initial velocity. Since Φ is a β-isomorphism, the initial velocity of the (continuous, semialge-
braic) path ˜γ := Φ ◦γ is horizontal; and since Ψ is a β-isomorphism, the initial velocity of the
(continuous, semialgebraic) path (Ψ ◦Φ) ◦γ = Ψ ◦˜γ is horizontal. By Proposition 6, Ψ ◦Φ is
a β-isomorphism of degree d.
■
Proposition 8. The germ of the identity map I : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) is a β-isomorphism of
degree d, for each d ≥1.
Proof. Fix any d ≥1.
Clearly, there exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ) and
G(X, Y ) of degree d such that G◦I = F: take any β-quasihomogeneous polynomial F(X, Y ) of
degree d (for example, F(X, Y ) = Xd) and set G = F. Also, for any continuous semialgebraic
path γ : [0, ǫ) →R2 whose initial velocity is horizontal, the initial velocity of ˜γ := Φ ◦γ is
horizontal, because ˜γ = γ. By Proposition 6, I is β-isomorphism of degree d.
■
Proposition 9. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz map. If Φ is
a β-isomorphism of degree d then Φ−1 is a β-isomorphism of degree d.
Proof. Since Φ is a β-isomorphism of degree d, there exist β-quasihomogeneous polynomials
F(X, Y ), G(X, Y ) of degree d such that G ◦Φ = F. Hence, there exist β-quasihomogeneous
polynomials ˜F(X, Y ), ˜G(X, Y ) of degree d such that ˜G ◦Φ−1 = ˜F: for example, take ˜G = F
and ˜F = G. Now, we show that for any continuous semialgebraic path ˜γ : [0, ǫ) →R2 whose
initial velocity is horizontal, the initial velocity of γ := Φ−1 ◦˜γ is horizontal. Fix one such path
˜γ : [0, ǫ) →R2. Let α+, α−: [0, ǫ) →R2 be the (continuous semialgebraic) paths deﬁned by
α+(t) = (t, 0) and α−(t) = (−t, 0). Since Φ is a β-isomorphism, the initial velocities of the
paths ˜α+ := Φ ◦α+ and ˜α−:= Φ ◦α−are both horizontal and have opposite directions. So, the
initial velocity of ˜γ (which is horizontal) has either the same direction as the initial velocity
of ˜α+ or the same direction as the initial velocity of ˜α−. Since Φ is bi-Lipschitz, it follows
that the initial velocity of γ = Φ−1 ◦˜γ has either the same direction as the initial velocity of
α+ = Φ−1 ◦˜α+ or the same direction as the initial velocity of α−= Φ−1 ◦˜α−. In any case, the
initial velocity of γ is horizontal. By Proposition 6, Φ−1 is β-isomorphism of degree d.
■
Remark 3. Every β-isomorphism is composable with its inverse.
11
Now, we proceed to the deﬁnition of the β-transform.
Given a β-isomorphism Φ =
(Φ1, Φ2) : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0), we deﬁne λ := (λ+, λ−) and φ := (φ+, φ−), where:
λ+ := lim
x→0+
Φ1(x, 0)
x
,
λ−:= lim
x→0−
Φ1(x, 0)
x
φ+(t) := |λ+|−β · lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, t |x|β)
|x|β
,
φ−(t) := |λ−|−β · lim
x→0−
Φ2(x, t |x|β)
|x|β
We deﬁne the β-transform of Φ to be the ordered pair (λ, φ).
From the deﬁnitions above, it follows that, for each t ∈R:
Φ1(x, t |x|β) = λx + o(x)
as x →0
(7)
Φ2(x, t |x|β) = |λ|β φ(t) |x|β + o(|x|β)
as x →0
(8)
where
(
λ = λ+ and φ = φ+,
if x > 0
λ = λ−and φ = φ−,
if x < 0 .
Proposition 10. Let Φ = (Φ1, Φ2) and Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2) be β-isomorphisms of the same degree
such that Ψ is composable with Φ, and let Z := Ψ ◦Φ. Let (λ, φ), (µ, ψ) be the β-transforms of
Φ, Ψ, respectively. We have:
i. Asympotic formula for Z1(x, 0).
Z1(x, 0) = λµx + o(x) as x →0,
(9)
where
(
λ = λ+, µ = µ+,
if x > 0
λ = λ−, µ = µ−,
if x < 0
or
(
λ = λ+, µ = µ−,
if x > 0
λ = λ−, µ = µ+,
if x < 0 ,
according as Φ is direct or reverse, respectively.
ii. Asympotic formula for Z2(x, t |x|β), with t ﬁxed.
Z2(x, t |x|β) = |λµ|β ψ(φ(t)) |x|β + o(|x|β) as x →0,
(10)
where
(
λ = λ+, µ = µ+, φ = φ+, ψ = ψ+,
if x > 0
λ = λ−, µ = µ−, φ = φ−, ψ = ψ−,
if x < 0
or
(
λ = λ+, µ = µ−, φ = φ+, ψ = ψ−,
if x > 0
λ = λ−, µ = µ+, φ = φ−, ψ = ψ+,
if x < 0 ,
according as Φ is direct or reverse, respectively.
Proof. By applying formula (7) successively to Φ and Ψ, we obtain:
Z1(x, 0) = Ψ1(Φ(x, 0))
= Ψ1(λx, |λ|β φ(0) |x|β) + o(x)
= λµx + o(x)
12
Now, let t ∈R be ﬁxed. By deﬁnition,
Z2(x, t |x|β) = Ψ2(˜x, Φ2(x, t |x|β)),
where ˜x := Φ1(x, t |x|β).
Applying (8) and (7) successively, we obtain:
Φ2(x, t |x|β) = |λ|β φ(t) |x|β + o(|x|β)
= φ(t) |˜x|β + o(|x|β)
Thus,
Ψ2(˜x, Φ2(x, t |x|β)) = Ψ2(˜x, φ(t) |˜x|β) + o(|x|β)
= |µ|β ψ(φ(t)) |˜x|β + o(|x|β)
= |λµ|β ψ(φ(t)) |x|β + o(|x|β) .
■
Corollary 3. Let Φ = (Φ1, Φ2) and Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2) be β-isomorphisms, and let Z := Ψ ◦Φ. Let
(λ, φ), (µ, ψ), and (ν, ζ) be the β-transforms of Φ, Ψ, and Z, respectively. We have:
(ν, ζ) =
(
((λ+µ+, λ−µ−), (ψ+ ◦φ+, ψ−◦φ−)) ,
if Φ is direct
((λ+µ−, λ−µ+), (ψ−◦φ+, ψ+ ◦φ−)) ,
if Φ is reverse
Proof. Dividing both sides of (9) by x and then successively letting x →0+ and x →0−, we
obtain:
(
ν+ = λ+µ+ and ν−= λ−µ−,
if Φ is direct
ν+ = λ+µ−and ν−= λ−µ+,
if Φ is reverse
Thus, equation (10) can be rewritten as
Z2(x, t |x|β) = |ν|β ψ(φ(t)) |x|β + o(|x|β) as x →0,
(11)
where
(
ν = ν+, φ = φ+, ψ = ψ+,
if x > 0
ν = ν−, φ = φ−, ψ = ψ−,
if x < 0
or
(
ν = ν+, φ = φ+, ψ = ψ−,
if x > 0
ν = ν−, φ = φ−, ψ = ψ+,
if x < 0 ,
according as Φ is direct or reverse, respectively.
Dividing both sides of (11) by |x|β and then successively letting x →0+ and x →0−, we
obtain:
(
ζ+ = ψ+ ◦φ+ and ζ−= ψ−◦φ−,
if Φ is direct
ζ+ = ψ−◦φ+ and ζ−= ψ+ ◦φ−,
if Φ is reverse
■
Corollary 4. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a β-isomorphism, and let (λ, φ) be the β-transform
of Φ. The β-transform of Φ−1 is given by:
( (λ−1
+ , λ−1
−), (φ−1
+ , φ−1
−)

,
if Φ is direct
 (λ−1
−, λ−1
+ ), (φ−1
−, φ−1
+ )

,
if Φ is reverse
13
Proposition 11. Let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) be a β-isomorphism, and let (λ, φ) be the β-
transform of Φ. We have:
(a) λ+ and λ−are nonzero real numbers and they have the same sign.
(b) φ+ and φ−are both bi-Lipschitz functions.
Proof. By Remark 1, the paths Φ(x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, and Φ(−x, 0), 0 ≤x < ǫ, both have ﬁnite
nonzero initial velocities, so λ+ = limx→0+ Φ1(x, 0)/x and λ−= limx→0−Φ1(x, 0)/x are both
nonzero real numbers. As pointed out just after the proof of Proposition 5, λ+ and λ−have
the same sign.
By (8), for any ﬁxed t and t′, we have:
φ+(t) −φ+(t′) = |λ+|−β · Φ2(x, t |x|β) −Φ2(x, t′ |x|β)
|x|β
+ o(|x|β)
|x|β ,
as x →0+
and
φ−(t) −φ−(t′) = |λ−|−β · Φ2(x, t |x|β) −Φ2(x, t′ |x|β)
|x|β
+ o(|x|β)
|x|β ,
as x →0−.
On the other hand, since Φ2 is Lipschitz, there exists K > 0 (independent of x, t, t′) such
that
Φ2(x, t |x|β) −Φ2(x, t′ |x|β)
 ≤K |t −t′| |x|β .
Thus,
|φ+(t) −φ+(t′)| ≤|λ+|−β K |t −t′| + o(|x|β)
|x|β
as x →0+
and
|φ−(t) −φ−(t′)| ≤|λ−|−β K |t −t′| + o(|x|β)
|x|β
as x →0−.
By successively letting x →0+ and x →0−, we obtain:
|φ+(t) −φ+(t′)| ≤|λ+|−β K |t −t′|
and
|φ−(t) −φ−(t′)| ≤|λ−|−β K |t −t′| .
Therefore, φ+ and φ−are both Lipschitz functions.
Up to this point, our argument shows that, for any β-isomorphism Φ, the functions φ+
and φ−are both Lipschitz. By Corollary 4, this implies that φ−1
+ and φ−1
−are both Lipschitz
too.

R-semialgebraic Lipschitz equivalence and height func-
tions
Two real β-quasihomogeneous polynomials F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) of degree d ≥1 are said to
be R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent if there exists a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz
homeomorphism Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) such that G ◦Φ = F.
With each β-quasihomogeneous polynomial F(X, Y ), we associate two polynomial func-
tions: the right height function f+ : R →R, given by f+(t) := F(1, t), and the the left height
function f−: R →R, given by f−(t) := F(−1, t).
14
In this section, we show that if any two β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of a certain
special type are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent, then their height functions can be
arranged in pairs of Lipschitz equivalent functions (Corollary 5).
Proposition 12. Let F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥
1. Suppose that G ◦Φ = F, for a certain β-isomorphism Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0). Let f+, f−be
the height functions of F, g+, g−the height functions of G, and let (λ, φ) be the β-transform of
Φ. We have:
(
g+ ◦φ+ = |λ+|−d f+
and
g−◦φ−= |λ−|−d f−,
if Φ is direct
g−◦φ+ = |λ+|−d f+
and
g+ ◦φ−= |λ−|−d f−,
if Φ is reverse
Proof. By hypothesis, G(Φ(x, y)) = F(x, y). Thus, for all t ∈R and x ̸= 0 suﬃciently small,
G(Φ(x, t |x|β)) = F(x, t |x|β) .
Since F is β-quasihomogeneous, this implies that
G(Φ(x, t |x|β)) = |x|d f(t),
where
f =
(
f+,
if x > 0
f−,
if x < 0 .
Multiplying both sides of this equation by |x|−d, we obtain:
G
 
Φ1(x, t |x|β)
|x|
, Φ2(x, t |x|β)
|x|β
!
= f(t)
Letting x →0+, it follows that
G
 
λ+, lim
x→0+
Φ2(x, t |x|β)
|x|β
!
= f+(t) .
Hence,
g(φ+(t)) = |λ+|−d f+(t),
(12)
where
g =
(
g+,
if λ+ > 0
g−,
if λ+ < 0 .
Similarly, letting x →0−, it follows that
G
 
−λ−, lim
x→0−
Φ2(x, t |x|β)
|x|β
!
= f−(t) .
Hence,
g(φ−(t)) = |λ−|−d f−(t),
(13)
where
g =
(
g−,
if λ−> 0
g+,
if λ−< 0 .
Clearly, equations (12) and (13) yield the result.

Theorem 1. Let F(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1.
Suppose that F and G are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent, and let Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0)
be a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism such that G ◦Φ = F.
If V (F)∩{x > 0} ̸= ∅and V (F)∩{x < 0} ̸= ∅, then Φ is a β-isomorphism. Moreover,
we have:
(
g+ ◦φ+ = |λ+|−d f+
and
g−◦φ−= |λ−|−d f−,
if Φ is direct
g+ ◦φ−= |λ−|−d f−
and
g−◦φ+ = |λ+|−d f+,

where f+, f−are the height functions of F, g+, g−are the height functions of G, and (λ, φ) is
the β-transform of Φ.
Proof. Suppose that V (F) ∩{x > 0} ̸= ∅and V (F) ∩{x < 0} ̸= ∅.
Since
V (F) ∩{x > 0} =
[
t∈f−1
+ (0)

(x, txβ) : x > 0
	
,
the condition V (F) ∩{x > 0} ̸= ∅implies that f −1
+ (0) ̸= ∅.
Take t0 ∈R such that f+(t0) = 0. In the notation used in the proof of Proposition 4, we

for x > 0 suﬃciently small. Since limx→0+
Φ1(x, t0 |x|β)/x
 < ∞(this is guaranteed by Remark
1 along with equation (3)), it follows that Φ2(x, t0 |x|β)/ |x|β is bounded, for x > 0 suﬃciently
small.
Similarly, the assumption that V (F) ∩{x < 0} ̸= ∅ensures the existence of t1 ∈R such
that f−(t1) = 0 and then , by adapting the argument above, we can prove that Φ2(x, t1 |x|β)/ |x|β
is bounded, for x < 0 suﬃciently small. By Proposition 4, it follows that Φ is a β-isomorphism.
Now, the ﬁnal statement is an immediate consequence of Proposition 12.

The group of proto-transitions
Let R∗be the multiplicative group of all nonzero real numbers, and let L be the group of all
bi-Lipschitz Nash diﬀeomorphisms on R. Let H := {(λ1, λ2) ∈R∗× R∗: λ1λ2 > 0} (considered
as a subgroup of the direct product R∗× R∗), and let K := L × L (direct product). Deﬁne a
binary operation on H × K by setting:
(µ, ψ) ◦(λ, φ) :=
(
((λ1µ1, λ2µ2), (ψ1 ◦φ1, ψ2 ◦φ2)) ,
if λ > 0
((λ1µ2, λ2µ1), (ψ2 ◦φ1, ψ1 ◦φ2)) ,
if λ < 0
for all (λ, φ) = ((λ1, λ2), (φ1, φ2)) and (µ, ψ) = ((µ1, µ2), (ψ1, ψ2)), where λ > 0 means that
λ1 > 0 and λ2 > 0, and λ < 0 means that λ1 < 0 and λ2 < 0.
16
Proposition 13. (H × K, ◦) is a group. We call it the group of proto-transitions.
Proof. Let (H × K, ·) be the direct product of H and K, so that
(µ, ψ) · (λ, φ) = ((λ1µ1, λ2µ2), (ψ1 ◦φ1, ψ2 ◦φ2)) .
We express the operation ◦in terms of the operation · , and then we use this expression
to show that (H × K, ◦) is a group.
Let ι : H × K →H × K be the identity map and
τ : H × K →H × K be given by τ((λ1, λ2), (φ1, φ2)) = ((λ2, λ1), (φ2, φ1)).
Deﬁne θ : H →Aut(H × K) by
θ(λ) :=
(
ι,
if λ > 0
τ,
if λ < 0
Clearly, θ is a group homomorphism.
Let π : H × K →H be the projection homomorphism. Then, α := θ ◦π : H × K →
Aut(H × K) is a group homomorphism such that:
i. α ◦ϕ = α for all ϕ ∈Im α
ii. Im α is an abelian subgroup of Aut(H × K)
Also, we have:
(µ, ψ) ◦(λ, φ) = (α(λ, φ)(µ, ψ)) · (λ, φ).
Hence, the result follows from the following lemma.
Lemma 5. Let (G, ·) be a group and let α : G →Aut(G) be a group homomorphism satisfying
the following conditions:
i. α ◦ϕ = α for all ϕ ∈Im α
ii. Im α is an abelian subgroup of Aut(G)
Deﬁne a new operation ◦on G by setting g ◦h := (α(h)(g)) · h. Then, (G, ◦) is a group.
Proof of Lemma 5. First, we prove that the new operation is associative. For all g1, g2, g3 ∈G,
we have:
(g1 ◦g2) ◦g3 = (α(g2)(g1) · g2) ◦g3
= α(g3) (α(g2)(g1) · g2) · g3
= α(g3) (α(g2)(g1)) · α(g3)(g2) · g3
(14)
On the other hand,
g1 ◦(g2 ◦g3) = g1 ◦(α(g3)(g2) · g3)
= α(α(g3)(g2) · g3)(g1) · α(g3)(g2) · g3
= α(α(g3)(g2))(α(g3)(g1)) · α(g3)(g2) · g3
(i)= α(g2)(α(g3)(g1)) · α(g3)(g2) · g3
(ii)
= α(g3)(α(g2)(g1)) · α(g3)(g2) · g3
(15)
17
From (14) and (15), it follows that (g1 ◦g2) ◦g3 = g1 ◦(g2 ◦g3).
Now we prove that the identity element 1 of the group (G, ·) is also an identity element
of G with respect to the operation ◦. In fact, for all g ∈G, we have:
1 ◦g = α(g)(1) · g = 1 · g = g
g ◦1 = α(1)(g) · 1 = id(g) = g
Finally, we prove that each element g ∈G has an inverse with respect to the operation ◦.
First, notice that for all g, h ∈G,
h ◦g = 1 ⇔α(g)(h) · g = 1 ⇔α(g)(h) = g−1 ⇔h = α(g)−1(g−1) ⇔h = α(g−1)(g−1) .
Thus, h = α(g−1)(g−1) is a left inverse of g with respect to the operation ◦. Let us show that
h is also a right inverse of g. In fact,
g ◦α(g−1)(g−1) = α(α(g−1)(g−1))(g) · α(g−1)(g−1)
(i)= α(g−1)(g) · α(g−1)(g−1)
= α(g−1)(g · g−1) = α(g−1)(1) = 1 .
Hence, h = α(g−1)(g−1) is the inverse of g with respect to the operation ◦.
■
Now, we deﬁne a family of actions of the group of proto-transitions on the set Cω × Cω,
where Cω is the set of all real analytic functions on R.
Proposition 14. For each d ≥1, the map ◦: (Cω × Cω) × (H × K) →Cω × Cω deﬁned by
(g1, g2) ◦(λ, φ) :=




|λ1|d g1 ◦φ1, |λ2|d g2 ◦φ2

,
if
λ > 0

|λ1|d g2 ◦φ1, |λ2|d g1 ◦φ2

,
if
λ < 0
is an action of the group of proto-transitions on Cω × Cω.
Proof. First, we notice that the map
• : (Cω × Cω) × (H × K) →Cω × Cω given by
(g1, g2) • (λ, φ) := (|λ1|d g1 ◦φ1, |λ2|d g2 ◦φ2)
is an action of the direct product (H × K, ·) on Cω × Cω. In fact, we have:
((g1, g2) • (µ, ψ)) • (λ, φ) = (|µ1|d g1 ◦ψ1, |µ2|d g2 ◦ψ2) • (λ, φ)
= (|λ1|d |µ1|d (g1 ◦ψ1) ◦φ1, |λ2|d |µ2|d (g2 ◦ψ2) ◦φ2)
= (|λ1µ1|d g1 ◦(ψ1 ◦φ1), |λ2µ2|d g2 ◦(ψ2 ◦φ2))
= (g1, g2) • ((µ, ψ) · (λ, φ))
and
(g1, g2) • ((idR, idR), (1, 1)) = (|1|d g1 ◦idR, |1|d g2 ◦idR) = (g1, g2)
Now, we express the map ◦in terms of the action
• , and then we use this expression to
show that the map ◦is an action of the group of proto-transitions on Cω × Cω.
Denote by Bij(Cω×Cω) the group of all bijections on Cω×Cω. Let I : Cω×Cω →Cω×Cω
be the identity map and T : Cω × Cω →Cω × Cω be given by T(g1, g2) = (g2, g1). Deﬁne
Θ : H →Bij(Cω × Cω) by
Θ(λ) :=
(
I,
if
λ > 0
T,
if
λ < 0 .
Clearly, Θ is a group homomorphism. Let π : H × K →H be the projection homomorphism.
Then A := Θ ◦π : (H × K, ◦) →Bij(Cω × Cω) is a group homomorphism such that:
18
I. A(µ, ψ)((g1, g2) • (λ, φ)) = (A(µ, ψ)(g1, g2)) • α(µ, ψ)(λ, φ), where α = θ ◦π : H × K →
Aut(H × K, ·) is the group homomorphism deﬁned in the proof of Proposition 13.
II. Im A is an abelian subgroup of Bij(Cω × Cω).
Also, we have:
(g1, g2) ◦(λ, φ) = (A(λ, φ)(g1, g2)) • (λ, φ).
Hence, the result follows from the following lemma.
Lemma 6. Let us use the notation of the Lemma 5. Also, let X be a set,
• : X × (G, ·) →X
a group action, and A : (G, ◦) →Bij(X) a group homomorphism satisfying the following
conditions:
I. A(h)(x • g) = (A(h)(x)) • α(h)(g) for all x ∈X and g, h ∈G.
II. Im A is an abelian subgroup of Bij(X).
Then, the map ◦: X × (G, ◦) →X deﬁned by
x ◦g := (A(g)(x)) • g
is a group action.
Proof of Lemma 6. For all x ∈X and g, h ∈G, we have:
(x ◦g) ◦h = (A(h)(x ◦g)) • h = (A(h)((A(g)(x)) • g)) • h
(I)
= ((A(h)(A(g)(x))) • α(h)(g)) • h = ((A(h) ◦A(g))(x)) • (α(h)(g) · h)
(II)
= ((A(g) ◦A(h))(x)) • (α(h)(g) · h) = (A(g ◦h)(x)) • (g ◦h)
= x ◦(g ◦h)
Also, for all x ∈X,
x ◦1 = (A(1)(x)) • 1 = A(1)(x) = idX(x) = x.

β-transitions and the inverse β-transform
Denote by P the set of all real polynomial functions on R. A proto-transition (λ, φ) is said to
be a β-transition if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
i. There exist pairs of nonconstant polynomial functions (f1, f2), (g1, g2) ∈P × P such that
(g1, g2) ◦(λ, φ) = (f1, f2)
ii. |λ1|β · lim
|t|→∞
φ1(t)
t
= |λ2|β · lim
|t|→∞
φ2(t)
t
Remark 4. The limits in (ii) are well-deﬁned. In fact, for any homeomorphism φ : R →R, if
there exist nonconstant polynomial functions f, g : R →R such that g ◦φ = f, then the limit
lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t exists and is ﬁnite.
19
Remark 5. The identity element ((1, 1), (idR, idR)) of the group of the proto-transitions is a β-
transition, which we call the identity β-transition, and the inverse (with respect to the operation
◦) of a β-transition is a β-transition.
Given a β-transition (λ, φ), we deﬁne a map Φ : R2 →R2 by setting:
• Φ(x, t |x|β) :=

λ1x, |λ1|β φ1(t) |x|β
,
for x > 0, t ∈R
• Φ(x, t |x|β) :=

λ2x, |λ2|β φ2(t) |x|β
,
for x < 0, t ∈R
• Φ(0, y) :=

=

0, |λ2|β
lim
|t|→+∞
φ2(t)
t
y

,
for all y ∈R
The inverse β-transform of (λ, φ) is the germ Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) determined by the map Φ.
Lemma 7. Let φ, ψ : R →R be functions for which the limits lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t and lim|t|→+∞ψ(t)/t
exist and are nonzero. Then,
lim
|t|→+∞
ψ(φ(t))
t
=
lim
|t|→+∞
ψ(t)
t
·
lim
|t|→+∞
φ(t)

Proof. Since lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)/t| > 0, we have lim|t|→+∞|φ(t)| = +∞. Then,
lim
|t|→+∞
ψ(t)
t
=

Hence,

Proposition 15. Let (λ, φ) and (µ, ψ) be β-transitions, let Φ and Ψ be their respective inverse
β-transforms, and let Z be the inverse β-transform of (µ, ψ) ◦(λ, φ). Then, Z = Ψ ◦Φ.
Proof. For all x > 0, t ∈R,
Ψ(Φ(x, t |x|β)) = Ψ

Now, we prove that Z(0, y) = Ψ(Φ(0, y)), for all y ∈R. For λ > 0, we have:
Z(0, y) =

Proposition 16. The inverse β-transform of the identity β-transition is the germ of the identity
map I : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0).
Proof. Immediate from the deﬁnition.
■
Corollary 6. Let (λ, φ) be a β-transition and Φ its inverse β-transform. Then, the inverse
β-transform of (λ, φ)−1 is Φ−1.
Now, we prove that the inverse β-transform of a β-transition is a germ of bi-Lipschitz
map.
Lemma 8. Let φ : R →R be a bi-Lipschitz function such that g ◦φ = f for some nonconstant
polynomial functions f, g : R →R, and let λ be a nonzero real number.
Then, the map
Φ : H →R2, deﬁned on the right half-plane H := {(x, y) ∈R2 : x > 0} by
Φ(x, txβ) := (λx, |λ|β φ(t)xβ)
for all x > 0 and t ∈R, is Lipschitz on the strip Hδ := {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 < x < δ}, for each
δ > 0.
Proof. Let δ > 0 be ﬁxed. We prove that Φ is Lipschitz on both the upper half-strip Hδ∩{y > 0}
and the lower half-strip Hδ ∩{y < 0}. Let us see that this implies the result. Assuming this
claim, and using the fact that Φ is continuous, we see that there exists a constant C > 0 such
that
|Φ(x1, y1) −Φ(x2, y2)| ≤C |(x1, y1) −(x2, y2)| ,
(16)
whenever (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) both belong to Hδ ∩{y ≥0} or to Hδ ∩{y ≤0}. We show that
(16) still holds for (x1, y1) ∈Hδ ∩{y ≥0} and (x2, y2) ∈Hδ ∩{y ≤0}. Let (¯x, 0) be the point
at which the line segment whose endpoints are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) intersects the x-axis. By
our assumptions, we have:
|Φ(x1, y1) −Φ(¯x, 0)| ≤C |(x1, y1) −(¯x, 0)|
21
and
|Φ(¯x, 0) −Φ(x2, y2)| ≤C |(¯x, 0) −(x2, y2)| .
Hence,
|Φ(x1, y1) −Φ(x2, y2)| ≤|Φ(x1, y1) −Φ(¯x, 0)| + |Φ(¯x, 0) −Φ(x2, y2)|
≤C (|(x1, y1) −(¯x, 0)| + |(¯x, 0) −(x2, y2)|)
= C |(x1, y1) −(x2, y2)| ,
where the last equality holds because the point (¯x, 0) lies in the segment whose endpoints are
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, our initial claim implies that Φ is Lipschitz on the strip Hδ.
In order to establish our initial claim, we ﬁrst show that for each ﬁxed pair of points
(x1, t1xβ
1) and (x2, t2xβ
2), either both on Hδ ∩{y > 0} or both on Hδ ∩{y < 0}, with x1 ̸= x2
and t1 ̸= t2, there exist ω between x1 and x2, and τ between t1 and t2 such that
φ(t2)xβ
2 −φ(t1)xβ
1 = (φ(τ) −τφ′(τ)) · βωβ−1 · (x2 −x1) + φ(t2) −φ(t1)
t2 −t1
· (t2xβ
2 −t1xβ
1)
(17)
In fact,
φ(t2)xβ
2 −φ(t1)xβ
1 = (φ(t1) + q · (t2 −t1))xβ
2 −φ(t1)xβ
1, where q = φ(t2) −φ(t1)
t2 −t1
= φ(t1) · (xβ
2 −xβ
1) + q · (t2xβ
2 −t1xβ
2)
= φ(t1) · (xβ
2 −xβ
1) + q · (t2xβ
2 −t1xβ
1) + q · t1 · (xβ
1 −xβ
2)
= (φ(t1) −q · t1) · (xβ
2 −xβ
1) + q · (t2xβ
2 −t1xβ
1)
= t2φ(t1) −t1φ(t2)
t2 −t1
· (xβ
2 −xβ
1) + φ(t2) −φ(t1)
t2 −t1
· (t2xβ
2 −t1xβ
1)
(18)
Since the points (x1, t1xβ
1) and (x2, t2xβ
2) are either both on Hδ ∩{y > 0} or both on
Hδ ∩{y < 0}, the real numbers t1, t2 are either both positive or both negative. Thus, by
Pompeiu’s Mean Value Theorem [3, p. 1 – 2], there exists a real number τ between t1 and t2
such that
t2φ(t1) −t1φ(t2)
t2 −t1
= φ(τ) −τφ′(τ).
(19)
Also, by Lagrange’s Mean Value Theorem, there exists a real number ω between x1 and
x2 such that
xβ
2 −xβ
1 = βωβ−1 · (x2 −x1).
(20)
Substituting (19) and (20) in (18), we obtain (17).
Now, since φ is Lipschitz, there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that

φ(t2) −φ(t1)
t2 −t1
 ≤C1,
for t1 ̸= t2. On the other hand, since φ(t) −tφ′(t) is bounded (see next section), there exists a
constant C2 > 0 such that
(τφ′(τ) −φ(τ)) · βωβ−1 ≤C2,
provided that 0 < x1, x2 < δ.
Applying these bounds to (17), we obtain:
φ(t2)xβ
2 −φ(t1)xβ
1
 ≤C ·

|x2 −x1| +
t2xβ
2 −t1xβ


,
where C = max{C1, C2}, for any pair of points (x1, t1xβ
1) and (x2, t2xβ
2), either both on Hδ ∩
{y > 0} or both on Hδ ∩{y < 0}, thereby proving our initial claim.

Corollary 7. Let (λ, φ) be a β-transition, and let Φ : R2 →R2 be the map deﬁned by:

Then, there exist δ > 0 such that Φ is Lipschitz on the strip {(x, y) ∈R2 : |x| < δ}.
Proof. By Lemma 8, there exist C+ > 0 and δ+ > 0 such that Φ|Hδ+ : Hδ+ →R2 is C+-
Lipschitz. Since Φ|Hδ+ is uniformly continuous and takes values in R2 (which is a complete
metric space), it has a unique continuous extension eΦ to e
Hδ+ := {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x < δ+}.
Let us show that eΦ = Φ| e
Hδ+. Obviously, eΦ(x, y) = Φ(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈Hδ+. And for all
y ∈R, we have:

Hence, Φ| e
Hδ+ is the continuous extension of Φ|Hδ+ to e
Hδ+. And since Φ|Hδ+ is C+-Lipschitz, it
follows that Φ| e
Hδ+ is C+-Lipschitz too.
Similarly, we can prove that there exist C−> 0 and δ−> 0 such that Φ|−e
Hδ−: −e
Hδ−→R2
is C−-Lipschitz.
Therefore, Φ is C-Lipschitz on the strip {(x, y) ∈R2 : |x| < δ}, where
C = max{C+, C−} and δ = min{δ+, δ−}.

Corollary 8. The inverse β-transform Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) of every β-transition (λ, φ) is a
germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz map.
Proof. Since φ1 and φ2 are both semialgebraic functions, it is immediate from the deﬁnition of
the inverse β-transform that Φ is a germ of semialgebraic map. And by Corollary 7, both Φ
and Φ−1 (which is the inverse β-transform of (λ, φ)−1, by Corollary 6) are germs of Lipschitz
maps. Hence the result.
■
Proposition 17. Let F, G ∈R[X, Y ] be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1,
and let f+, f−be the height functions of F and g+, g−the height functions of G. Suppose that
(g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−) for some β-transition (λ, φ). Then, G ◦Φ = F, where Φ is the
inverse β-transform of (λ, φ).
Proof. First, we show that
G(λ1, |λ1|β φ1(t)) = F(1, t)
and
G(−λ2, |λ2|β φ2(t)) = F(−1, t).
(21)
We consider separately the cases λ > 0 and λ < 0.
23
If λ > 0, we have
|λ1|d · g+ ◦φ1 = f+
and
|λ2|d · g−◦φ2 = f−.
Equivalently,
|λ1|d · G(1, φ1(t)) = F(1, t)
and
|λ2|d · G(−1, φ2(t)) = F(−1, t).
Thus, using the fact that the polynomials F and G are β-quasihomogeneous of degree d, we
obtain (21).
If λ < 0, we have
|λ1|d · g−◦φ1 = f+
and
|λ2|d · g+ ◦φ2 = f−.
Equivalently,
|λ1|d · G(−1, φ1(t)) = F(1, t)
and
|λ2|d · G(1, φ2(t)) = F(−1, t).
Again, using the fact that the polynomials F and G are β-quasihomogeneous of degree d, we
obtain (21).
Now, by using once more the fact that the polynomials F and G are β-quasihomogeneous
of degree d, we obtain from (21):
G(λ1x, |λ1|β φ1(t) |x|β) = F(x, t |x|β)
for x > 0, t ∈R
and
G(λ2x, |λ2|β φ2(t) |x|β) = F(x, t |x|β)
for x < 0, t ∈R.
In other words,
G(Φ(x, y)) = F(x, y)
for all (x, y) ∈R2, with x ̸= 0.
Since Φ is continuous3, we have G(Φ(x, y)) = F(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈R2.

The boundedness of φ(t) −tφ′(t)
Let φ : R →R be a bi-Lipschitz function such that g ◦φ = f for some nonconstant polynomials
f, g : R →R. We already know that φ is bi-analytic (Lemma 2). In this section, we prove that
the function φ(t) −tφ′(t) is bounded.4
Consider the function bφ : R∗∪{∞} →R deﬁned by
bφ(t) :=
(
φ(t)/t,
if t ∈R∗
lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t,
if t = ∞
By Lemma 1, bφ is a well-deﬁned continuous function. We prove that bφ is analytic at ∞. As a
consequence, we obtain the boundedness of φ(t) −tφ′(t).
3Clearly, Φ is continuous on the right half-plane {(x, y) ∈R2 : x > 0} and also on the left half-plane
{(x, y) ∈R2 : x < 0}. By Corollary 7, Φ is Lipschitz (and therefore continuous) on a strip {(x, y) ∈R2 : |x| < δ}.
Since the right half-plane, the left half-plane, and the strip around the y-axis form an open cover of the plane,
it follows that Φ is continuous.
4The approach taken here was suggested by Prof. Maria Michalska.
24
In order to do this, we consider the coordinate representation of bφ on the chart centered
at ∞, which is the function ψ : R →R given by
ψ(t) :=
(
tφ(t−1),
if t ∈R \ {0}
lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t,
if t = 0
.
Claim. ψ is analytic.
Proof. Clearly, ψ is analytic at every point t ∈R \ {0}, so we focus on proving the analiticity
of ψ at t = 0. Let P(X, Y ) := g(Y ) −f(X) and let P ∗(X, Y, Z) be the homogeneization of P.
Also, let f(t) = Pd
i=0 aiti and g(t) = Pd
i=0 biti, where ad, bd ̸= 0 and d ≥1, so
P(X, Y ) =
d
X
i=0
biY i −

aiXi
and
P ∗(X, Y, Z) =
d
X
i=0
biY iZd−i −
d
X
i=0
aiXiZd−i.
Since g(φ(t)) = f(t), we have P(t, φ(t)) = 0 for all t ∈R. Equivalently, P ∗(t, φ(t), 1) = 0
for all t ∈R. Since P ∗is homogeneous, it follows that P ∗(1, φ(t)/t, 1/t) = 0 for all t ∈R \ {0}.
Equivalently,
P ∗(1, tφ(t−1), t) = 0
for all t ∈R \ {0}.
Let eP(Y, Z) := P ∗(1, Y, Z). From the computations above, it follows that
eP(ψ(t), t) = 0
for all t ∈R.
Now we prove that the equation eP(y, z) = 0 determines y as an analytic function of z in a
neighborhood of (l, 0), where l := lim|t|→+∞φ(t)/t. This will give the desired conclusion.
The partial derivatives of eP at (y, 0) are given by
∂eP
∂y (y, 0) = d · bd · yd−1
and
∂eP
∂z (y, 0) = bd−1 · yd−1 −ad−1.
Since eP(l, 0) = 0 and ∂eP
∂y (l, 0) = d·bd·ld−1 ̸= 0 (by Lemma 1, we have l ̸= 0), there is an analytic
function eψ : I →J from an open interval I containing 0 to an open interval J containing l
such that
eP(y, z) = 0 ⇔y = eψ(z),
for all y ∈J, z ∈I.
Since ψ is continuous and ψ(0) = l, there exists an open interval I0 ⊆I containing 0 such that
ψ(t) ∈J for all t ∈I0. And since eP(ψ(t), t) = 0 for all t ∈I0, it follows that ψ(t) = eψ(t) for all
t ∈I0. Hence, ψ is analytic at t = 0.
■
Finally, we can prove that the function φ(t) −tφ′(t) is bounded. From the deﬁnition of
ψ, we see that
φ(t)
t
= ψ(t−1)
for all t ∈R \ {0}.
Diﬀerentiating both sides of this equation, we get
φ′(t) · t −φ(t)
t2
= −ψ′(t−1)
t2
for all t ∈R \ {0}.
25
Equivalently, we have
φ(t) −tφ′(t) = ψ′(t−1)
for all t ∈R \ {0}.
Hence,
lim
|t|→+∞φ(t) −tφ′(t) = ψ′(0).
Since the function φ(t)−tφ′(t) is continuous on R, the existence of this limit implies its bound-
edness.

A characterization of β-transitions
Let F, G ∈R[X, Y ] be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1, and let f+, f−be the
height functions of F and g+, g−the height functions of G. Suppose that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) =
(f+, f−) for some proto-transition (λ, φ). We are interested in determining when (λ, φ) can be
chosen among the β-transitions.
Denote by eF the multiplicity of X as a factor of F (in R[X, Y ]), and by eG the multiplicity
of X as a factor of G. Then F(X, Y ) = XeF · eF(X, Y ) and G(X, Y ) = XeG · eG(X, Y ), where
X ∤eF(X, Y ) and X ∤eG(X, Y ).
Claim 1. eF = eG
Proof. Let β = r/s, where r > s > 0 and gcd(r, s) = 1. Since F and G are β-quasihomogeneous
polynomials of degree d, we have:
F(X, Y ) =
m
X
k=0
akXd−rkY sk
and
G(X, Y ) =
n
X
k=0
bkXd−rkY sk,
where am ̸= 0, bn ̸= 0, and 0 ≤m, n ≤⌊d/r⌋. Then, eF = d −rm and eG = d −rn.
We prove that m = n; by the equations above, this implies that eF = eG. Since f+(t) =
Pm
k=0 aktsk and f−(t) = Pm
k=0(−1)d−rkaktsk, we have deg f+ = deg f−= sm; and since g+(t) =
Pn
k=0 bktsk and g−(t) = Pn
k=0(−1)d−rkbktsk, we have deg g+ = deg g−= sn. Thus, since f+
and f−are Lipschitz equivalent to g+ and g−in some order (by assumption, (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) =
(f+, f−) for some proto-transition (λ, φ)), it follows that sm = sn. Therefore, m = n.
■
From now on, we drop the subscript and denote simply by e the multiplicity of X as a
factor of either F or G.
Claim 2. For all t > 0, we have:
eF(tX, tβY ) = td−e eF(X, Y )
and
eG(tX, tβY ) = td−e eG(X, Y )
Proof. Since F is a β-quasihomogeneous polynomial of degree d,
F(tX, tβY ) = tdF(X, Y )
= tdXe eF(X, Y ).
On the other hand, since the multiplicity of X as a factor of F is equal to e,
F(tX, tβY ) = (tX)e eF(tX, tβY )
= teXe eF(tX, tβY ).
26
Hence,
teXe eF(tX, tβY ) = tdXe eF(X, Y ).
Therefore,
eF(tX, tβY ) = td−e eF(X, Y ).
Obviously, the deduction above with F replaced by G yields the other equation.
■
Let us brieﬂy consider the case where e = d. In this case, we have F = aXd and G = bXd,
with a, b ̸= 0. The next proposition tells us how to determine whether any two such polynomials
are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent.
Proposition 18. Let F(X, Y ) = aXd and G(X, Y ) = bXd, where a, b ∈R \ {0} and d ≥1.
i. If d is even, then F and G are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent if and only if a
and b have the same sign.
ii. If d is odd, then F and G are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent.
Proof. (i) Suppose that d is even. If there exists a germ of semialgebraic bi-Lipschitz homeo-
morphism Φ : (R2, 0) →(R2, 0) such that G ◦Φ = F then b · Φ1(x, y)d = axd in a neighborhood
of the origin, which implies that a and b have the same sign, since d is even. Now, assuming
that a and b have the same sign, we have G ◦Φ = F, Φ(x, y) =

■
Since our goal is ultimately to determine whether any two given β-quasihomogeneous
polynomials are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent, from now on we focus on the case
where e < d.

Notice that
|λ1|d · g+(φ1(t)) = f+(t) ⇒|λ1|d · G(1, φ1(t)) = F(1, t)

Proposition 19. Let F, G ∈R[X, Y ] be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1,
none of which being of the form cXd, and let f+, f−be the height functions of F and g+, g−
the height functions of G. Suppose that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−) for some proto-transition
(λ, φ). Then (λ, φ) is a β-transition if and only if the following conditions hold:
i. φ1 and φ2 are coherent (i.e. they are either both increasing or both decreasing)
ii. None of the polynomials F, G has X as a factor, or λ1 = λ2.
Proof. First, suppose that (λ, φ) is a β-transition. Then, we have
|λ1|β ·
lim
|t|→+∞
φ1(t)
t
= |λ2|β ·
lim
|t|→+∞
φ2(t)

.
(26)
Since |λ1| > 0 and |λ2| > 0, it follows that lim|t|→+∞φ1(t)/t and lim|t|→+∞φ2(t)/t have the
same sign. And since φ1 and φ2 are monotonic, this implies that they are coherent. Hence,
condition (i) is satisﬁed.
Since (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−), where (λ, φ) is a proto-transition, the multiplicity of X
as a factor of F is equal to the multiplicity of X as a factor of G (Claim 1). Let us denote by e
the multiplicity of X both as a factor of F and as a factor of G. Since none of the polynomials
F, G is of the form cXd, we have e < d. So, by Claim 3,
|λ1|

Since the limits lim|t|→+∞φ1(t)/t and lim|t|→+∞φ2(t)/t have the same sign, it follows that

.
(28)
Since the limits lim|t|→+∞φ1(t)/t and lim|t|→+∞φ2(t)/t are both nonzero (because φ1 and
φ2 are bi-Lipschitz), it follows from equations (26) and (28) that
|λ1|

|λ1|β

(29)
Equivalently,
|λ1|

eβ
d−e .
(30)
Furthermore, this equality holds if and only if e = 0 or |λ1| = |λ2|. And since λ1 and λ2 have
the same sign, this is equivalent to condition (ii). Since (30) actually holds, condition (ii) is
satisﬁed.
Now, in order to prove the converse, suppose that conditions (i) and (ii) hold. Since
(g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−), where (λ, φ) is a proto-transition, (27) still holds for this part of
the argument. Thus, condition (i) implies (28). On the other hand, as we have just proved,
condition (ii) is equivalent to (29). Since we are assuming that condition (ii) is satisﬁed, (29)
holds. From (28) and (29), we obtain (26). Therefore, (λ, φ) is a β-transition.
■
Corollary 9. Let F, G ∈R[X, Y ] be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1, none
of which being of the form cXd, and let f+, f−be the height functions of F and g+, g−the
height functions of G. Also, let β = r/s, where r > s > 0 and gcd(r, s) = 1. Suppose that
(g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−) for some proto-transition (λ, φ). Then, we have:
(a) If r is even or s is odd, then there exists a β-transition (˜λ, ˜φ) such that (g+, g−)◦(˜λ, ˜φ) =
(f+, f−).
(b) If s is even, then there exists ˜φ = (˜φ1, ˜φ2), with ˜φ1 and ˜φ2 coherent, such that (g+, g−) ◦
(λ, ˜φ) = (f+, f−).
Proof. Let F(X, Y ) = Pn
k=0 akXd−rkY sk and G(X, Y ) = Pn
k=0 bkXd−rkY sk, with an, bn ̸= 0,
n ≥1. (In the proof of Claim 1 we showed that the upper limit of summation n is the same
for F and G, provided that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−) for some proto-transition (λ, φ). Also,
we have n ≥1 because none of the polynomials F, G is of the form cXd.) Now, we proceed to
the proof of items (a) and (b).
(a) Case 1. r is even
In this case, we have f−(t) = (−1)d · f+(t) and g−(t) = (−1)d · g+(t). In fact,
f−(t) =
n
X
k=0
ak · (−1)d−rk · tsk = (−1)d ·
n
X
k=0
aktsk = (−1)d · f+(t).
The same reasoning, with f replaced by g, gives the other equation.
By hypothesis, there exists a proto-transition (λ, φ) such that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−).
We claim that (g+, g−) ◦(˜λ, ˜φ) = (f+, f−), where ˜λ = (λ1, λ1) and ˜φ = (φ1, φ1). In fact,
if λ > 0 then |λ1|d · g+ ◦φ1 = f+ and hence
|λ1|d · g−(φ1(t)) = (−1)d · |λ1|d · g+(φ1(t)) = (−1)d · f+(t) = f−(t),

so we also have |λ1|d · g−◦φ1 = f−. If λ < 0 then |λ1|d · g−◦φ1 = f+ and hence
|λ1|d · g+(φ1(t)) = (−1)d · |λ1|d · g−(φ1(t)) = (−1)d · f+(t) = f−(t),
so we also have |λ1|d · g+ ◦φ1 = f−. By Proposition 19, (˜λ, ˜φ) is a β-transform.
Case 2. r and s are both odd
In this case, we have f−(t) = (−1)d · f+(−t) and g−(t) = (−1)d · g+(−t). In fact,
f−(t) =
n
X
k=0
(−1)d−rk · ak · tsk = (−1)d ·
n
X
k=0
(−1)kaktsk = (−1)d · f+(−t).
The same reasoning, with f replaced by g, gives the other equation.
By hypothesis, there exists a proto-transition (λ, φ) such that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−).
We claim that (g+, g−)◦(˜λ, ˜φ) = (f+, f−), where ˜λ = (λ1, λ1) and ˜φ(t) = (φ1(t), −φ1(−t)).
In fact, if λ > 0 then |λ1|d · g+ ◦φ1 = f+ and hence
|λ1|d · g−(−φ1(−t)) = (−1)d · |λ1|d · g+(φ1(−t)) = (−1)d · f+(−t) = f−(t),
so we also have |λ1|d · g−(−φ1(−t)) = f−(t). If λ < 0 then |λ1|d · g−◦φ1 = f+ and hence
|λ1|d · g+(−φ1(−t)) = (−1)d · |λ1|d · g−(φ1(−t)) = (−1)d · f+(−t) = f−(t),
so we also have |λ1|d · g+(−φ1(−t)) = f−(t). By Proposition 19, (˜λ, ˜φ) is a β-transform.
(b) Suppose that s is even. Then, we have g+(−t) = g+(t) and g−(−t) = g−(t). In fact,
g+(−t) =
n
X
k=0
bk(−t)sk =
n
X
k=0
bktsk = g+(t)
and
g−(−t) =
n
X
k=0
(−1)d−rk · bk(−t)sk =
n
X
k=0
(−1)d−rk · bktsk = g−(t).
By hypothesis, there exist a proto-transition (λ, φ) such that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−).
We claim that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−), where φ = (φ1, −φ2). In fact, if λ > 0 then
|λ2|d · g−◦φ2 = f−and hence |λ2|d · g−◦(−φ2) = f−(because g−is an even function). If
λ < 0 then |λ2|d · g+ ◦φ2 = f−and hence |λ2|d · g+ ◦(−φ2) = f−(because g+ is an even
function).
Finally, notice that φ1 is coherent with either φ2 or −φ2. If φ1 and φ2 are coherent, we
take ˜φ = φ. If φ1 and −φ2 are coherent, we take ˜φ = φ.

Theorem 2. Let F, G be β-quasihomogeneous polynomials of degree d ≥1, none of which being
of the form cXd, and let f+, f−be the height functions of F and g+, g−the height functions of G.
Also, let β = r/s, where r > s > 0 and gcd(r, s) = 1. Suppose that (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−)
for some proto-transition (λ, φ). If any of the following conditions is satisﬁed then F and G
are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent:
(a) r is even or s is odd
31
(b) λ1 = λ2
(c) None of the polynomials F, G has X as a factor.
Proof. If r is even or s is odd then, by Corollary 9, there exists a β-transition (˜λ, ˜φ) such that
(g+, g−) ◦(˜λ, ˜φ) = (f+, f−). Then G ◦Φ = F, where Φ is the inverse β-transform of (˜λ, ˜φ).
Now, assume that either (b) or (c) holds. If s is odd, then condition (a) is satisﬁed, and
therefore F and G are R-semialgebraically Lipschitz equivalent, as we have just proved. If s
is even then, by Corollary 9, there exists ˜φ = (˜φ1, ˜φ2), with ˜φ1 and ˜φ2 coherent, such that
(g+, g−) ◦(λ, ˜φ) = (f+, f−). Since we are assuming that either (b) or (c) holds, Proposition 19
guarantees that (λ, ˜φ) is a β-transition. Hence, G ◦Φ = F, where Φ is the inverse β-transform
of (λ, ˜φ).

Next, we present an example in which condition (b) of Theorem 2 is satisﬁed whereas
conditions (a) and (c) are not.
Example 1. Let F(X, Y ) = XY 4 + 8X4Y 2 + 16X7 and G(X, Y ) = XY 4 + 18X4Y 2 + 81X7.
These polynomials are both β-quasihomogeneous of degree 7, with β = 3/2. In this example,
r = 3 and s = 2, so condition (a) of Theorem 2 is not satisﬁed. Also, notice that X is a factor
of both F and G, so condition (c) is not satisﬁed either. Let us show that condition (b) is
satisﬁed.
The height functions of F are f+(t) = t4 + 8t2 + 16 and f−(t) = −t4 + 8t2 −16. f+ has
only one critical point t = 0, which has multiplicity 2 and is the point where f+ attains its
minimum value: 16. f−has three distinct critical points: −2, 0, 2, and its multiplicity symbol
is ((0, −16, 0), (2, 2, 2)).
The height functions of G are g+(t) = t4 + 18t2 + 81 and g−(t) = −t4 + 18t2 −81. g+
has only one critical point t = 0, which has multiplicity 2 and is the point where g+ attains its
minimum value: 81. g−has three distinct critical points: −3, 0, 3, and its multiplicity symbol
is ((0, −81, 0), (2, 2, 2)).
By Propositions 2 and 3, there exist bi-Lipschitz functions φ1, φ2 : R →R such that
g+ ◦φ1 = cf+
and
g−◦φ2 = cf−,
where c = 81/16. Thus, (g+, g−) ◦(λ, φ) = (f+, f−), where φ = (φ1, φ2) and λ = (c−1/7, c−1/7).
So condition (b) of Theorem 2 is satisﬁed, and therefore F and G are R-semialgebraically
Lipschitz equivalent.
