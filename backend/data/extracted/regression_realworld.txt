Abstract.
We report direct measurements of the frequency ratio of the 642 THz
2S1/2(F = 0)–2F7/2(F = 3) electric octupole transition in 171Yb+
and the
429 THz 1S0–3P0 transition in 87Sr.
A series of 107 measurements has been
performed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt between December 2012
and October 2019.
Long-term variations of the ratio are larger than expected
from the individual measurement uncertainties of few 10−17.
The cause of
these variations remains unknown.
Even taking these into account, we ﬁnd a
fractional uncertainty of the frequency ratio of 2.5 × 10−17, which improves upon
previous knowledge by one order of magnitude.
The average frequency ratio
is νYb+/νSr = 1.495 991 618 544 900 537(38).
This represents one of the most
accurate measurements between two diﬀerent atomic species to date.

Optical frequency ratio of a 171Yb+ single-ion clock and a 87Sr lattice clock

1. Introduction
The International System of Units (SI) has been
revised fundamentally in 2019, redeﬁning several of its
base units [1].
While the deﬁnition of the SI base
unit of time, the ‘second’, has remained essentially
unchanged, there has been tremendous progress in
time and frequency metrology over the past decades
[2]. In particular, optical atomic clocks have surpassed
primary realizations of the second in terms of frequency
instability [3, 4, 5] and systematic uncertainty [6, 7, 8,
9] by two orders of magnitude or more.
Thus, the
International Committee for Weights and Measures
recommends standard frequency values of several
atomic transitions [10] as Secondary Representations
of the Second (SRS) [11].
They presently include
nine transitions with fractional uncertainties between
4 × 10−16 and 2 × 10−15; eight of these are optical
transitions [10]. Recently, measurements of transition
frequencies with uncertainties near and even below
2 × 10−16 have been reported for transitions in optical
clocks using
171Yb [12] and
87Sr [5, 13].
These
absolute frequency measurements are limited by the
uncertainty of the 133Cs primary frequency standards
(PFS) serving as the reference.
Since the ratio
ρ of any two unperturbed atomic clock transition
frequencies is a universal, dimensionless constant, the
direct determination of an optical frequency ratio via
a frequency comb [14] permits signiﬁcantly smaller
uncertainty.
The Working Group of Strategic Planning of
the Consultative Committee for Time and Frequency
has
presented
a
roadmap
towards
a
redeﬁnition
of the second based on an optical transition that
outlines the guiding requirements on optical clocks
[10]. Measurements of optical clock frequency ratios
with uncertainties below 5 × 10−18 are among the
milestones of this roadmap.
Furthermore, direct
intercomparisons
are
essential
for
applications
in
fundamental research, such as searches for variations
of fundamental constants [15, 16] or indications of dark
matter [17], and in applied sciences, e.g., in geosciences
for measuring geopotential diﬀerences [18, 19].
Various means to compare the optical clocks of
diﬀerent laboratories have been investigated. Phase-
stabilized optical ﬁbre links and satellite-based links
permit remote frequency ratio measurements over
continental [20] and intercontinental distances [21],
respectively.
Transportable optical clocks [22, 23,
19] enable comparisons without direct interconnection
between laboratories.
Another approach is based
on measuring the frequency ratio of a heterogeneous
pair
of
clocks
(ρ
̸=
1)
locally.
The
ratios
determined at diﬀerent laboratories can be reported
and subsequently compared to evaluate the clock
performances.
Moreover, closures of the pairwise
frequency ratios between three or more types of
clocks can be used to test reproducibility, even if
only a single laboratory operates a speciﬁc pair.
Evaluations of closures at the level of 10−16 fractional
uncertainty have been reported recently [12, 13, 24].
Due to the correlations between optical frequency ratio
measurements, new methods [25, 26] have emerged for
their combined evaluation, e.g., in the context of SRS
[10].
Comparisons of optical clocks using diﬀerent
species with uncertainty below 1 × 10−16 have been
reported by several groups [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 24,
32].
Here, we report on direct comparisons of a
171Yb+
single-ion clock realizing the
2S1/2(F
=
0)–2F7/2(F
= 3) electric octupole (E3) transition
frequency νYb+ ≈642 THz and a 87Sr optical lattice
clock interrogating the (5s2) 1S0–(5s5p) 3P0 transition
at νSr
≈
429 THz.
A series of measurements
with uncertainties of few 10−17 has been conducted
at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),
spanning a period of seven years. These are the ﬁrst
measurements reported for this speciﬁc pair of clock
species to date. We investigate the reproducibility of
our measurements and derive an average value of the
frequency ratio.
2. Experimental setup
We compare the Yb+
single-ion clock Yb-1 and the
Sr optical lattice clock at PTB and measure their
frequency ratio ρYb+/Sr = νYb+/νSr directly by means
of an optical frequency comb. The clocks are located
in diﬀerent buildings at a distance of about 200 m on
the PTB campus. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental
setup; a detailed description is given below.
2.1. Frequency combs and links
In each building, an optical frequency comb (FC) is
linked by an optical ﬁbre to the local oscillator (LO)
of the respective clock. To establish a phase-coherent
link between the two frequency combs, light from
transfer lasers, TL(Yb) and TL(Sr), operating near
344 THz and 194 THz, is sent to both combs. All ﬁbre
links shown in ﬁgure 1 are actively phase-stabilized.
Using the transfer oscillator scheme [14], we determine
the frequency ratio ρYb+/Sr from radio-frequency (rf)
beat signals.
Here, we typically employ the TL(Sr)
transfer laser and use TL(Yb) to validate link and
comb performance during measurements.
Dead-time-free counters record the frequencies of
all rf signals required to determine ρYb+/Sr.
They
are operated in phase-averaging mode (Λ-mode) with
a gate time of 1 ms,
a report time of 1 s,
and
synchronized to a common pulse-per-second (PPS)
signal.

oﬀsets caused by drifts of the acquired signals and
rejects noise from the transfer lasers and combs. The
PPS signal and a 100 MHz reference are transmitted
from the building housing the Yb+
clock to the one
housing the Sr clock, using high-quality rf cables (see
also [5]).
We monitor the phase stabilization of the ﬁbre
paths
to
and
between
the
combs
by
counting
the respective in-loop beat frequencies,
as phase
ﬂuctuations on the paths enter directly into the
calculation of ρYb+/Sr. Some of the rf signals are band-
pass-ﬁltered by electronic tracking with phase-locked
voltage-controlled oscillators before being counted. In
these cases, we track and count two replicas with
diﬀerent settings of the phase-locked loops. Diﬀerences
of the two frequencies indicate cycle slips of a tracking
oscillator.
Invalid data are ﬁltered out in post-
processing.
2.2. Yb+ single-ion clock
The ytterbium ion clock Yb-1 at PTB has been
described in detail in previous publications [33, 16,
34, 7].
It realizes the frequency of the 2S1/2(F =
0)–2F7/2(F = 3) E3 transition using a single 171Yb+
ion conﬁned in a radio-frequency Paul trap.
The
clock has recently been evaluated with a fractional
systematic uncertainty of 2.7 × 10−18 [7].
During
the measurements reported here, the clock has been
operated either with this systematic uncertainty or the
slightly larger uncertainty reported in [34].
Since early 2017, the noise properties of the
probe laser are signiﬁcantly improved by stabilizing
it to a laser system referenced to the length of a
cryogenic silicon cavity (Si-2) [35].
As a result,
the fractional instability of the frequency ratio as
expressed by the Allan deviation (ADEV) σy(τ),
where τ is the averaging time, reduces from σy(τ) ≈
4.3 × 10−15(τ/s)−1/2 to σy(τ) ≈1.0 × 10−15(τ/s)−1/2
(see ﬁgure 2).
2.3. Sr lattice clock
The laboratory strontium lattice clock at PTB has
been described in previous publications [36, 37, 38, 20,
5]. We interrogate the (5s2) 1S0–(5s5p) 3P0 transition
of a few hundred laser-cooled
87Sr atoms that are
conﬁned in a nearly horizontal optical lattice.
All measurements reported in this article have
been performed using one apparatus, which underwent
the following modiﬁcations:
We replaced the plate
capacitor, which had been used to measure the static
diﬀerential polarizability of the Sr clock transition
[39], by a copper structure, into which the atomic
sample can be transported for interrogation with well-
controlled BBR (‘cold environment’) [40], in late 2014.
However, it was not used for any of the measurements
reported here.
Its temperature was monitored and
included in the evaluation of the BBR ﬁeld.
We
removed it in early 2018 (see section 3.1).
Several
laser systems have been replaced over time [41, 42].
We have been using the same titanium:sapphire lattice
laser system since 2014. Its output is spectrally ﬁltered
by a volume Bragg grating, which has a full width at

half maximum of about 60 GHz, as a precaution to
avoid light shifts due to ampliﬁed spontaneous emission
(ASE).
The
fractional
systematic
uncertainty
of
the
strontium clock has been improved gradually from
3 × 10−17 [36] to about 1.5 × 10−17 [5] (see table 1).
As improved interrogation laser systems [41, 35]
have become available, we frequently operate the
clock with an additional dead time of one to two
seconds between subsequent interrogation cycles (‘low-
uncertainty mode’).
This reduces the thermal load
on the physics package and results in decreased
blackbody radiation (BBR) uncertainty [5],
while
preserving an acceptable frequency instability (see
below).
In the current apparatus, this uncertainty
is limited both by the temperature inhomogeneity
of the vacuum system itself and by the temperature
gradient along the main magnetic ﬁeld coils, which are
water-cooled and located inside the vacuum system.
We have also improved our characterization of the
frequency shift due to BBR from the strontium oven
by a factor of eight, using a mechanical shutter
for a direct measurement of the diﬀerential eﬀect
[5]. The improved characterization has been applied
retroactively to earlier measurements.
Moreover, we
have reduced the uncertainty of optical lattice light
shifts by a factor of three [5], using a procedure similar
to the ‘operational magic wavelength’ [43] to better
account for correlations of light shift contributions. We
use a light-shift model that accounts for a possible
intensity imbalance between the lattice beams due to
reﬂection losses. It is equivalent to the model presented
in [44].
The strontium clock’s frequency instability has
been improved from about σy(τ) ≈6 × 10−16(τ/s)−1/2
to σy(τ) ≈2 × 10−16(τ/s)−1/2 [37] by an improved
local oscillator [41].
It has been reduced further, to
σy(τ) ≈5 × 10−17(τ/s)−1/2 [5], by transferring the
stability of Si-2 [35] to LO(Sr) in 2016. These values
refer to operating the clock without additional dead
time (‘high-stability mode’). In low-uncertainty mode,
frequency instability is higher, but still nearly an order
of magnitude below that of the Yb+ clock.
For the measurements reported here, the Sr clock
has usually been operated in low-uncertainty mode,
with
fractional
systematic
uncertainties
typically
between 1.5 × 10−17 and 2 × 10−17. We also include
some data from high-stability operation, e.g., the
monitoring of lattice light shifts.
Typically, the
uncertainty of these measurements has been only
slightly
larger,
mainly
between
1.8 × 10−17
and
3.0 × 10−17.
2.4. Gravitational redshift correction
The
fractional
gravitational
redshift
between
the
Sr lattice clock and Yb-1 has been determined as
69.5(5) × 10−18 [45].
3. Data analysis
We have performed a series of frequency comparisons
between the Yb+
clock and the Sr clock directly
in the optical domain, as discussed in section 2.
This series consists of a total of 107 measurements
recorded between December 2012 and October 2019.
Figure 3 shows the measured values of the frequency

ratio ρYb+/Sr by date.
The improved frequency
stability of Yb-1 since 2017 has enabled an increased
rate of measurements, because it reduces the typical
measurement
duration
required
for
a
statistical
uncertainty of about 1 × 10−17 to a few hours. This has
been particularly useful for the investigations discussed
in section 3.1.
The measurements shown in ﬁgure 3 are typically
separated by interruptions of considerable duration or
by deliberate changes of the operating conditions of
either clock; brief gaps within a data set are tolerated.
In total, we have recorded more than 1000 h of data.
The
fractional
uncertainty
of
an
individual
measurement is typically about 2.5 × 10−17,
with
comparable contributions from the systematics of the
Sr clock and statistics.
Notable exceptions include
the ﬁrst measurement from 2012, which had a higher
systematic uncertainty than later measurements, and
several brief measurements, which are dominated by
the statistical uncertainty.
As
shown
in
ﬁgure
3,
the
scatter
of
our
measurements is typically no more than a few parts
in 1017 on short time scales, but may be up to about
one part in 1016 over periods of half a year or longer.
For data sets up to a few days, we compute the
ADEV of the frequency ratio (see ﬁgure 2) and observe
no signiﬁcant deviation from white frequency noise
behaviour beyond the initial servo attack time. For the
full data set, we ﬁnd a reduced chi-square χ2
red = 1.9
with respect to the total uncertainties, however. This
shows that long-term scatter of the ratio seen in ﬁgure 3
is larger than expected from the uncertainties of the
individual measurements.
3.1. Investigation of potential unaccounted frequency
shifts
The unexpectedly large long-term variations of the
ratio may be caused by an incorrectly characterized
or unknown systematic frequency shift.
We have
thus been investigating the performance of both clocks
as well as that of the links and combs to exclude
or conﬁrm potential sources of error, since the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant variation of the ratio was observed in early
2017.
We
have
carefully
checked
the
experimental
setup and our evaluation of the systematic frequency
shifts. Where possible, we have not only reevaluated
systematic eﬀects by interleaving clock stabilizations
at diﬀerent settings in a single clock, but also by
monitoring the frequency ratio ρYb+/Sr. Moreover, we
have deliberately changed parts of the experimental
setup to verify that they have no inﬂuence on the
measured frequency ratio.
Yb+
clock
The following eﬀects have been investi-
gated for the single-ion clock:
• Excess micromotion in the Yb+
clock can be
caused by uncompensated DC electric ﬁelds at
the position of the ion and results in second-order
Doppler and Stark shifts.
It is monitored by
analyzing the ﬂuorescence light using the photon
correlation technique [46, 47] during the cooling
period of the clock cycle. Typically, we minimize
it as discussed in [34] once per day.
Because
of the large mass of the ytterbium ion, large
intentionally applied deviations from the optimal
conﬁguration of compensation ﬁelds only lead to
expected fractional frequency shifts on the order
of 10−17, marginally resolvable in the frequency
ratio.
• Light-shift
cancellation
is
important
for
the
realization of an optical clock based on the E3
transition.
For all measurements reported here,
we use a hyper-Ramsey interrogation sequence
[48] for which we control the step frequency that
compensates the light shift by Rabi spectroscopy
in interleaved interrogation cycles [34].
To
investigate for potential limitations of the light-
shift cancellation, the duration of Ramsey pulses
has
been
reduced
by
a
factor
of
two
and
consequently the light shift during the pulses by
a factor of four.
Furthermore, the free atomic
state evolution between Ramsey pulses has been
changed from 60 ms up to 450 ms.
• The ion trap drive rf amplitude
as well as
the orientation and magnitude of the externally
applied magnetic ﬁeld have mainly been kept
constant, but have been varied deliberately for
some measurements.
• The local oscillator LO(Yb) has been checked
for as a possible source of frequency shifts by
disabling the prestabilization to Si-2 for some
measurements.
Sr clock
The following eﬀects and systems have been
investigated for the lattice clock:
• The DC Stark shift due to residual electric ﬁelds
has been checked regularly by applying an external
electric ﬁeld as described in [38]. Moreover, the
magnetic ﬁeld coils eﬀectively shield the atomic
sample from its environment, especially, since
the cold environment has been removed (see
section 2.3). The electric potentials of the coils
themselves were measured directly.
• The lattice light shift has been monitored for
potential inconsistency with our model, e.g., due
to a residual ASE background.
We have varied
the operating conditions of the lattice laser (see

section 2.3), such as the pump laser power.
A
change in the lattice laser frequency due to the
improved treatment of lattice light shifts (see
section 2.3) serves as an additional test for such
inconsistencies.
• Stray light has been checked as a potential source
of additional light shifts, by selectively blocking
light sources or by installing additional mechanical
shutters in laser systems.
• The quadratic Zeeman shift has been checked
by varying the external magnetic ﬁeld during
spectroscopy by a factor of ﬁve.
• BBR from the Sr oven has been characterized
by measuring the frequency shift directly (see
section 2.3 and [5]).
• Collisions with the background gas, which may
cause frequency shifts, have varied over the course
of the measurement series, due to changes in resid-
ual pressure. Measured trap lifetimes range from
below 1 s through more than 5 s. Additionally, we
have installed a mass spectrometer to monitor the
composition of the background gas.
• Line pulling has been checked for by varying the
duration of the spectroscopy pulse by about a
factor of two.
• The local oscillator LO(Sr) has been checked for
as a possible source of frequency shifts.
We
have disabled the prestabilization to Si-2 for some
measurements. Likewise, the phase stabilization
from LO(Sr) to the atomic sample has been
disabled for other measurements, to check for
indications for uncompensated phase changes.
The latter measurements are not included in the
data set analyzed here.
• We have also checked the control system
of
the clock apparatus by introducing a variable
delay between preparation and interrogation, by
toggling the synchronization of the experimental
sequence to the mains phase, and by changing the
order of the four interrogations from which the
error signal is derived [36].
Frequency combs The investigations regarding the
frequency combs include the following tests and
modiﬁcations:
• The fractional frequency oﬀset and instability of
the comb-to-comb connection between the two
buildings including contributions from the combs

7
themselves are assessed regularly. The diﬀerence
between the fractional frequency ratios of the
transfer lasers TL(Yb) and TL(Sr) measured with
the two combs is smaller than 2 × 10−18 for
all data sets longer than 5 × 103 s, with typical
fractional instabilities of 3 × 10−17 at τ = 1 s,
3 × 10−18 at 103 s ≤τ ≤104 s, and 2 × 10−19
at τ = 106 s. All these quantities are well below
the uncertainty and instability of the fractional
frequency ratio of the two clocks at the respective
averaging times.
• Evaluation using a single frequency comb has
been
performed
to
exclude
any
considerable
contributions of the links and frequency combs to
the instability and uncertainty of the frequency
ratio measurement. To this end, the light ﬁeld of
LO(Yb) has been sent to FC(Sr) via a ﬁbre link for
some of the measurements in 2018. The frequency
ratio ρYb+/Sr was determined using only FC(Sr),
in addition to the method outlined in section 2.1.
Both results agreed on the level of the uncertainty
and instability as evaluated above using TL(Yb)
and TL(Sr).
We have not found any inconsistencies with our
evaluation of the systematic shifts or any signiﬁcant
correlation between recorded changes made to the
experimental setup and the frequency ratio in any of
these measurements.
3.2. Average frequency ratio
As discussed in section 3.1, the cause of the observed
long-term variations of the frequency ratio ρYb+/Sr
remains unknown. Larger scatter than expected from
the measurement uncertainty has also been observed
in other comparisons involving optical clocks [49, 32].
Similarly, we treat the excess scatter as the result of
a varying, unknown systematic frequency shift with
a constant, ‘dark’ uncertainty ud.
This approach
implicitly assumes that the shift scatters around zero
rather than an unknown oﬀset.
Our measurements strongly suggest that this shift
is predominantly varying slowly in time (see ﬁgure 3)
and thus correlated between measurements in temporal
proximity.
We determine ud/ρYb+/Sr = 18 × 10−18
by requiring that χ2
red = 1 for our data set if ud
is included as an additional constant uncertainty in
each measurement.
The average ratio of ρYb+/Sr
is the arithmetic mean with weights wi

The former is below

methods to conﬁrm that the value found for ρYb+/Sr
is robust and its uncertainty reproducible.

The resulting mean value of ρYb+/Sr
deviates from the result above by 2 × 10−18.
The
uncertainty of 5.0 × 10−17 resulting from the second
moment of the mixed PDF is slightly higher than
the uncertainty found above.
However, this method
does not account for the reduction of the statistical
uncertainty by averaging the individual measurements.
Optical frequency ratio of a 171Yb+ single-ion clock and a 87Sr lattice clock

4. Conclusion
A series of comparisons between a 171Yb+ (E3) single-
ion clock and a 87Sr optical lattice clock spanning a
period of seven years has been performed at PTB. The
frequency ratio ρYb+/Sr of the undisturbed clock tran-
sitions has been measured with individual measure-
ment uncertainties of few 10−17. These measurements
demonstrate how the increasing stability and robust-
ness of the clocks have enabled more frequent compar-
isons of the systems.
Our measurements have also revealed that the
frequency ratio of the clocks, while well-reproducible
within the clocks’ combined uncertainty in the short
term, exhibits an unexpectedly large scatter in the
long term.
These variations are on the order of
several 10−17, which is below the resolution of absolute
frequency measurements but exceeds the combined
uncertainty of the clocks (χ2
red
⪅
2).
In the
present case, no uncontrolled frequency shifts could
be identiﬁed despite an extensive search. While this
result is speciﬁc to the clocks used here, it highlights
the importance of direct comparisons of optical clocks
over extended periods of time or using multiple pairs
of clocks.
Taking the long-term variation into account, we
ﬁnd a frequency ratio of
ρYb+/Sr = 1.495 991 618 544 900 537(38)
between the clocks. This result can be compared to
future measurements of ρYb+/Sr at diﬀerent laborato-
ries, either directly or indirectly as part of a closure, to
investigate the reproducibility in the combined system
and to update the recommended frequency values of
the SRS [10]. The fractional uncertainty of 2.5 × 10−17
of our measurement improves upon knowledge from re-
cent absolute frequency measurements [5, 13, 16] by an
order of magnitude. Furthermore, it is one of the low-
est reported for comparisons of diﬀerent clock species;
a lower uncertainty has only been achieved in [32]. To
our knowledge, this is the only series of measurements
directly comparing optical clocks of diﬀerent type over
seven years or longer.
