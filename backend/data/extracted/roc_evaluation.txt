Abstract 
The anticipation of flash flood events is crucial to issue warnings to mitigate their 
impact. This work presents a comparison of two early warning systems for real-time 
flash flood hazard forecasting at regional scale. The two systems are based in a gridded 
drainage network and they use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard 
level in different points of the study area, considering the return period (in years) as the 
indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential difference between the systems is that 
one is a rainfall-based system (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall 
as the variable to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a 
system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the streamflows at pixel 
scale. The comparison has been done for three rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that 
 
2
resulted in severe flooding in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results 
obtained by the two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments 
and for large return periods (extreme floods).

1. Introduction 
Flash floods produce devastating effects worldwide. They affect steep and small to 
medium catchments (up to a few hundreds of square kilometres), and are typically 
induced by heavy rainfall in the upstream area. The lapse time between strong rainfall 
(the cause) and the flood (the effect) depends primarily on the features of the catchment, 
ranging from the order of tens of minutes in the smallest catchments to a few hours in 
the larger ones (Borga et al., 2008; Gaume et al., 2009; Marchi et al., 2010). In any case, 
this time is very short, frequently too short to activate the emergency response and 
effectively prevent damages in human activities, properties and life. Thus, anticipating 
this kind of hazard and getting some extra minutes or hours for better preparedness and 
response to mitigate their impact is a crucial and major challenge, especially because of 
the increase of their occurrence as result of climate change (Munich Re, 2018; 
Insurance Information Institute, 2017; Barthel and Neumayer, 2012). 
Among the difficulties encountered to increase the response time, the most important is 
the explosive nature of the rainfall events, usually characterized by convective systems 
producing highly variable rainfall that are very difficult to measure and forecast. Also, 
flash floods affect catchments at regional scale in areas that are often poorly or very 
poorly gauged, amplifying the intrinsic difficulties to adjust a rainfall-runoff model. In 
this context, the high space and time resolution of radar rainfall observations provide 
relevant information to produce both quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) and 
forecasts (QPF), which are fundamental for improving the efficiency of flash flood early 
warning systems (EWS). 
Classically, flood EWS provide real-time information of flood forecasts in specific river 
sections, which are used to issue warnings to support the response. These warnings are 
commonly triggered by the exceedance of a particular threshold, for instance the river 
 
4
bank overflow or a statistical frequency of occurrence). However, the limitations to 
implement an operational rainfall-runoff model over a large region and the difficulties 
to obtain reliable flow thresholds at the same scale have yield to alternative approaches. 
And since the rainfall on the upstream basin is the most important forcing factor to 
produce flow in a given point, this value (spatially averaged over the basin) can be used 
as the driving variable, leading to systems operationally simpler, although (at least in 
theory) less accurate. In what follows we will classify flood EWSs in these two main 
categories, and we will refer to them as flow-based or rainfall-based EWSs 
(Hapuarachchi et al., 2011). 
There have been several attempts over the world to implement flash flood EWSs to 
operationally produce distributed warnings at regional scale, and not just over gauged 
river sections (see for example the reviews of Alfieri et al., 2012 and Hapuarachchi et 
al., 2011). Usually this regional scale corresponds to a political region or country, or to 
a physical catchment managed by a water authority. 
The Flash Flood Guidance concept (FFG) is the base of one of the first operational flash 
flood EWSs. It consists in running a rainfall-runoff model in inverse mode to determine 
the amount of rainfall of a given duration needed to produce the overflow of the river 
bank. It was developed first by the US National Weather Service (NWS, see Clark et al., 
2014) and operationally implemented by the Hydrological Research Center (HRC). It 
was first applied in Central America in 2004 as CAFFG, comparing the rainfall 
estimated in real time with the FFG values. CAFFG uses satellite rainfall estimates, and 
the FFG thresholds were calculated using GIS and land surface properties 
(Georgakakos, 2005; Georgakakos, 2006; Modrick et al., 2014). In the USA, the 
Weather Forecast Offices of the NWS operate since 2010 this FFG scheme for regional 
flash flood forecasting in small streams, typically with a lapse time of less than 6 hours 
 
5
(Clark et al., 2014). The FFG system has also been extended to several regions in the 
framework of a WMO Programme (Georgakakos, 2018). 
At European scale, the European Flood Awareness System ( EFAS; Thielen et al. 2009, 
www.efas.eu) has been the first operational flood EWS. Initially, it was developed to 
increase preparedness for riverine floods in the EU using the hydrological model 
LISFLOOD, operated at 5x5 km2 resolution using COSMO-LEPS mesoscale ensembles 
as rainfall forecasts. 
Another operational flash flood EWS, the FF-EWS, was developed by CRAHI as part 
of the EHIMI project (2001-2010), and operationally applied in 2008 at the Water 
Agency of Catalonia (ACA) in Spain (Corral et al., 2009). The FF-EWS uses for the 
first time the basin-aggregated rainfall over the drainage network (explained in detail in 
section 2) to derive flash flood warnings over the Catalonia region using radar-based 
QPEs and QPFs. 
The concept of the rainfall-based FF-EWS was further developed in the framework of 
the FP7 EC project IMPRINTS (Sempere-Torres et al., 2011; Alfieri et al., 2011) giving 
raise to the European Precipitation Index based on Climatology (EPIC; Alfieri and 
Thielen, 2015) integrated operationally in EFAS since 2012. The EPIC index covers 
Europe and uses NWP forecasts of basin-aggregated rainfall for flash flood forecasting 
at a resolution of 1x1 km2. The hazard is computed comparing these basin-aggregated 
forecasts with a 20-year climatology of the same variable obtained from COSMO 
reforecasts. Since then, the EPIC index has evolved and has been recently replaced by 
ERIC (Raynaud et al., 2015), which takes into account the antecedent soil moisture. 
The FF-EWS system has been recently implemented at European scale in the context of 
the DG-ECHO project ERICHA (www.ericha.eu; Park et al., 2017; 2019), and it runs 
operationally as the radar-based flash flood forecasting module of the European Flood 
 
6
Awareness System, EFAS since March of 2017. The ERICHA system uses the radar 
composites produced by the EUMETNET programme OPERA to generate flash flood 
forecasts at European scale with a resolution of 1x1 km2 in real time. In this way, the 
ERICHA forecasts (obtained with radar QPE and QPF) become complementary to the 
ERIC product that uses NWP rainfall forecasts). 
In France, SCHAPI operates the flow-based AIGA system (Javelle et al., 2017). It uses 
a distributed rainfall-runoff model of the GR family to obtain flow forecasts over a 
gridded drainage network at 1 h and 1x1 km2 resolution. The warnings are provided in 
the form of return period exceedances using regionalized peak flow quantiles as 
thresholds. 
In summary, a number of operational flash flood EWS prefer the simplicity of the 
rainfall-based methods due to their lower implementation cost, data needs and computer 
requirements. Moreover, these methods have shown clear capacity to detect flood 
events using rainfall threshold exceedances. 
This capacity was first described by Guillot and Duband (1967) in their GRADEX 
method. They found that the gradient of the probability distribution of the annual 
maximum discharge tends to follow asymptotically the probability distribution of the 
annual maximum daily rainfall for high return periods. This was proved using long 
historical flood and rainfall records in France to show that the effect of the antecedent 
soil moisture is more relevant for flood events below 10 years return period, but it 
becomes less important as the exceedance probability of the rainfall event diminishes. 
Thus, using the gradient of the probability distribution of the rainfalls to extend the 
probability distribution of the flows was proved to be a better methodology to estimate 
high return periods flows than the direct analysis of the flow records. The GRADEX has 
been used systematically by Electricité de France and was adopted by the International 
 
7
Committee of Large Dams (ICOLD-CIGB) as one of their reference calculation 
methods (Duband et al., 1988, CIGB - ICOLD, 1992 and CIGB - ICOLD, 1994). In 
what regards flash flood EWS, the GRADEX method is a theoretical support to 
consider that rainfall-based methods can be used successfully to identify flood events 
with return periods over 10 years. 
In this context, the present work aims to perform a comparison between a rainfall-based 
and a flow-based EWS, comparing their results on selected case studies to understand 
the effect of the simplifications and testing the hypothesis of their similarity for high 
return periods. 
To carry out this comparison the Liguria region in Northwest Italy has been selected. 
This region and in general all the Mediterranean coast is an area particularly prone to 
suffer important flash floods. Large rainfall amounts produced by the combination of 
the warm sea and the abrupt orography is the main triggering cause, but also steep and 
narrow streams in catchments where population and urban development have increased 
in the recent past decades, often without an adequate flood urban planning. The main 
reason to select this region is the availability of the data required to perform the 
comparison, including the existence of the flow-based EWS Flood-PROOFS developed 
by CIMA (Silvestro et al., 2011; Silvestro and Rebora, 2012, Laiolo et al., 2014). It is 
operating at the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Liguria (ARPAL), 
monitoring the entire region. This system is based on the application of a distributed 
grid-based rainfall-runoff model, and is a good representative of a flow-based flood 
EWS applied at regional scale. 
On the other hand, we have used the rainfall-based FF-EWS developed by CRAHI 
(Corral et al., 2009) and used in the ERICHA project. The configuration used here has 
been applied to Liguria and is currently integrated in the real-time Multi-Hazard EWS 
 
8
developed in the H2020 project ANYWHERE, and hereafter it will be referred as the 
ERICHA system. Both the ERICHA and Flood-PROOFS systems assess the hazard in 
the form of probability of occurrence (or return period), and the comparison is made in 
these terms. 
We have analysed three important flood events that affected the Liguria region in the 
autumn of 2014, including the extraordinary flood event of 09 October 2014 (over 100 
years return period). For consistency purposes, rainfall inputs are the same for both 
systems (radar rainfall estimates during the selected events), and rainfall and flow 
thresholds are based on the same climatological dataset. Although both systems are 
designed to incorporate rainfall forecasts (QPF), for the sake of clarity only QPE are 
used in this study, thus concentrating the analysis on the intercomparison. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 and section 3 introduce the rainfall-based 
and the flow-based flood warning systems, respectively. Section 4 describes the study 
area, and Section 5 deals with the events and rainfall data. Section 6 is about the results. 
Finally, some concluding remarks are pointed out in Section 7. 
 
2. Description of the ERICHA rainfall-based EWS 
The ERICHA rainfall-based flood warning system (Corral et al., 2009; Alfieri et al., 
2011, 2017; Versini et al., 2014) estimates the probability of occurrence of the observed 
basin-aggregated rainfall (i.e. the rainfall averaged in the basin upstream of each point 
of the drainage network) by comparison with the thresholds obtained from a 
climatology of the same variable. 
The basin-aggregated rainfall is computed at each cell of a gridded drainage network 
considering different rainfall accumulation windows. The particularity of this system is 
that the accumulation window used to compute the warnings is set equal to the 
 
9
concentration time of the basin. Thus, each cell representing an upstream basin is 
related to an individual concentration time [currently the Kirpich (1940) formula is 
used], and computations to obtain the flash flood indicator are made for this duration. 
The basin-aggregated rainfall is estimated at each time step for each pixel of the 
drainage network and is compared to a set of basin-aggregated rainfall thresholds to 
assign a hazard level in the form of return period. Ideally, these thresholds should be 
related to a climatology of the basin-aggregated rainfall to assess the probability of 
exceedance. An interesting method to estimate this climatology is from long series of 
radar data. However, the lack of such long series to compute statistically significant 
thresholds, in this study they have been obtained by processing the Intensity-Duration-
Frequency (IDF) curves obtained by Boni et. al. (2007). Using rainfall series from 125 
raingauges, they applied a regional approach to derive rainfall frequencies over Liguria, 
choosing the two components extreme value (TCEV) distribution function as the parent 
distribution of the rainfall growth factor. These curves are spatially distributed over the 
grid, and they are referred to as point IDF, IP(Di,Fj). In practise, each rainfall duration 
and frequency are related to a rainfall intensity map. Subsequently, the IP(Di,Fj) maps 
are integrated over the drainage network to obtain basin-aggregated IDF maps, referred 
to as IC(Di,Fj). Since point precipitation frequency estimates are representative only for 
a limited area, approximating the areal estimates by averaging corresponding point 
precipitation frequency estimates will result in overestimation (Pavlovic et. al., 2016). 
Thus, a simple areal reduction factor is applied when calculating IC(Di,Fj) from point 
IP(Di,Fj), given by Ka=1-log10(S/15) (which is used in Spain for the design of discharge 
structures, MOPU, 1990), where S is the basin area in km2. 
 
10
If an important reservoir exists upstream of a cell, then the basin is split at the dam level 
and the upstream basin is not included for basin-aggregated computations (thus 
assuming total regulation). 
Then, given the QPE (and the QPF if available) at a specific operation time, the basin-
aggregated rainfall is computed at each cell over the drainage network, considering an 
accumulation window equal to the basin concentration time (operationally, the system 
only works with previously specified durations, and it uses the duration value closest to 
the concentration time). Comparing this against basin-aggregated rainfall thresholds for 
this specified duration, the frequency (representing the probability to exceed a given 
value) is derived over the forecasting window, normally expressed as a return period 
(average time between two occurrences). 
This procedure is simple and easy to implement at regional scale, needing only 
information about rainfall climatology to build the IDF curves, and a terrain elevation 
DEM to derive the drainage network and the concentration time map. 
 
3. Description of the Flood-PROOFS flow-based EWS 
The Flood-PROOFS system existing in the Liguria region is based on the application of 
the Continuum rainfall-runoff model (Silvestro et al., 2013; 2015), a continuous 
distributed hydrological model based on a simplified gridded drainage network that 
relies on a morphological approach (Giannoni et al., 2005). It is founded on a physically 
based description, but a number of simplifications allows the model to keep its 
parameters in a suitable number for calibration. This system uses a gridded drainage 
network (for coherence, the same as the ERICHA system). Infiltration and subsurface 
flows are described using a semi-empirical, but quite detailed, methodology based on a 
modification of the Horton algorithm (Bauer, 1974; Diskin and Nazimov, 1994; 
 
11
Gabellani et al., 2008); it accounts for soil moisture evolution even in conditions of 
intermittent and low-intensity rainfall (lower than the infiltration capacity of the soil). 
The energy balance is based on the so called ‘‘force restore equation” (Dickinson, 1988) 
which balances forcing and restoring terms, with explicit soil surface temperature 
prognostic computation. Vegetation interception is schematized with a storage which 
has a retention capacity (Sv) estimated with the Leaf Area Index data, while the water 
table and the deep flow are modelled with a distributed linear reservoir schematization 
and a simplified Darcy equation. 
The surface flow schematization distinguishes between hillslope and channelled flow by 
means of a morphologic filter defined by the expression 𝐴 𝑆!=C, where A is the 
contributing area upstream of each cell, S is the local slope, and k and C are constants 
that describe the geomorphology of the environment (Giannoni et al., 2000). The 
overland flow (hillslopes) is described by a linear reservoir scheme, while for the 
channelled flow the kinematic wave approach is applied (Wooding, 1965; Todini and 
Ciarapica, 2001). 
Continuum model has six parameters that require calibration at the basin scale: two for 
the surface flow routing: hillslope flow motion coefficient (uh) and channel friction 
coefficient (uc); two for the subsurface flow generation: mean field capacity (ct) and 
infiltration capacity at saturation (cf); and two for the deep flow and water table 
components: maximum capacity of the deep aquifer (VWmax) and the parameter of 
anisotropy (Rf). At the regional scale of Liguria, the model was calibrated using 
observed flow data from 11 level gauge stations (Davolio et. al., 2017), by means of a 
multi-objective function based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and the relative error on 
high flows. The six model parameters are assumed to be uniform at basin scale, and 
 
12
average parameters obtained in calibrated basins are imposed where no observations are 
available. 
At each cell of the region, the flow simulations from the Continuum model are 
compared with a set of flow thresholds to determine the return period. Over the region 
of Liguria, these thresholds were obtained from a statistical regional analysis (Boni et. 
al., 2007), where flood peaks were obtained applying a simple and robust rainfall-runoff 
model to each cell of the drainage network, using rainfall hyetographs given by a 
particular Alternating Block Method (Chow et. al., 1988) which maximise the peak 
response. These hyetographs were built based on the same rainfall frequencies (IDF 
information) that are used as thresholds in the ERICHA system. Boni et. al. (2007) 
verified that the peak flow annual maxima provided by this method are consistent with 
the regional flow analysis made using the historical data from 33 stream flow stations. 
 
4. Study area 
The Italian region of Liguria is a narrow strip of land about 250 km long and 20–30 km 
wide with an area of about 5400 km2. Because of the mountainous characteristics of the 
region, the main urban areas and towns have been established along the coast, often at 
the mouth of a river. Many basins are small, with an area of less than 100 km2, and 
prone to flash floods. Only a few catchments have a drainage area over 200 km2, but 
even in these cases their response times are also very short. 
The Liguria region has a real-time hydrometeorological network that provides a detailed 
set of meteorological variables. There are about 150 automatic weather stations, each 
one equipped with a rain gauge. The region is also covered by a Doppler polarimetric 
C-band radar, located on Mount Settepani at an altitude of 1386 amsl (see a more 
detailed description of the network in Silvestro et al., 2016). The rainfall data used in 
 
13
the present study corresponds to QPEs obtained from the observations of the Settepani 
radar. These rainfall estimates have been produced at 1x1 km2 and 10 minutes 
resolution, applying an algorithm that selects the optimal relationship between rainrate 
and dual polarisation radar variables based on a decision tree flowchart (Silvestro et al., 
2009). The same QPEs have been used as inputs to both ERICHA and Flood-PROOFS. 
Both EWS have used the information of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region 
with a resolution of 0.005 degrees both in longitude and latitude (at this latitude this 
means around 400 m in the WE direction and around 550 m in the SN direction). Flow 
directions were identified based on maximum local slope following the D8 approach 
(each cell is given a unique direction from its 8 neighbours, O'Callaghan and Mark, 
1984), and the drainage network is defined at the same DEM resolution. 
Figure 1 shows the DEM over the working domain where the flood warning systems 
have been applied, covering completely the Liguria region. A sub-area around Genova 
covering the zones most affected by the analysed events has been selected for 
displaying the results. The most important streams located in this sub-area are: the 
Bisagno creek (crossing the city of Genova), the Polcevera creek (with its outlet at the 
Genova port), the Entella river (formed by the junction between the Lavagna and the 
Sturla rivers at Carasco), and the Orba and the Scrivia rivers (these two flowing to the 
North to the Po plain). Six control points have been selected in these streams, allowing 
to analyse the temporal evolution of the results at local scale. Three of these selected 
points correspond to the location of existing stream gauges: Genova in the Bisagno 
creek (Passerella Firpo), Tiglieto in the Orba river and Panesi in the Entella river (see 
bottom panel of Fig. 1). 
 
5. Analysed events 
 
14
The autumn of 2014 was particularly rainy in Liguria. A concatenation of rainfall events 
affected the region causing important flash floods in several locations. We have selected 
three events that produced several local floods: 09 October, and 10 and 15 November. 
The event of October was particularly devastating and was in-depth described in a paper 
concerning the flood of the Bisagno creek (Silvestro et al., 2016). Daily accumulations 
over 200 mm were observed in a large area between Genova and La Spezia (about 80 
km South-East of Genova). Rainfall intensities were very extreme (for example, a 
raingauge located near Genova recorded more than 130 mm in one hour). The observed 
peak flow in the Bisagno creek (91 km2) was around 1100 m3/s, and about 800 m3/s in 
the Entella river (371 km2). Flash floods caused major damages over the region, there 
was one fatality and material damages were estimated in around 100 Million Euros. 
Compared to the event of 09 October, the other two selected events are of lesser 
importance, and the spatial affection of flooding was also smaller. The event of 10 
November mainly affected the Entella river (peak flow about 1300 m3/s), and small 
overflows were reported in the village of Carasco. On the event of 15 November, the 
most affected zone corresponds to the coast in the West of Genova, being reported local 
overflowing in the Polcevera creek around Pontedecimo, and also local damages in 
other creeks nearby. The Orba river also experienced a significant increase in discharge 
(peak flow about 500 m3/s at the stream gauge of Tiglieto), but without overflowing the 
main channel. A summary of the effects produced in these three events can be found in 
https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_di_alluvioni_e_inondazioni_in_Italia, and with less 
detail in http://floodlist.com/europe/1-killed-genoa-floods-italy. 
As a way to summarize the quality of the radar-based QPEs used in the study, Figure 2 
shows a comparison between raingauge observations and the collocated radar estimates 
in terms of both hourly and total rainfall accumulations (two scatter plots for each 
 
15
event). For the comparison, only raingauges located within 80 km from the radar 
location have been selected. 
The regression line for the event of 09 October 2014 shows a very small bias. In 
contrast, the two events of November present more scatter and show a clear trend to 
underestimation (regression slope about 0.70). The apparent differences between the 
first event and the other two can partly be explained by the spatial extent of the rainfall 
event, that in the first case was very limited and most of raingauges registered less than 
10 mm. 
These results show that these radar QPEs are already affected by several error sources, 
particularly range dependent (due to the Vertical Profile of Reflectivity, beam 
broadening or path attenuation, for example) and also related to the complex orography 
of the region (ground clutter, beam blocking). The quality of these products might affect 
the performance of the two flood warning systems and they may lead to underestimate 
the warning levels. In the ARPAL operation the radar QPEs are merged with raingauge 
data in order to minimise this problem. In this study, focused on the intercomparison, 
we assume that radar-only QPEs have enough quality to provide a valid basis to 
evaluate differences and similarities of the EWS simulations. 
 
6. Results 
The results obtained applying the two flood EWS are presented here. The first sections 
(6.1-6.3) focus separately on each event, summarizing the results on a map of the 
selected sub-area and showing the results obtained in some control points. Section 6.4 
presents the comparison between the two systems globally for the entire region, taking 
into account all the points of the drainage network and analysing the impact of several 
factors. 
 
16
Although both EWS provide results over the entire domain, the results are only 
displayed and analysed for the pixels with an associated drainage area larger than 4 km2. 
This threshold is chosen somehow arbitrarily, for aesthetic reasons (mapping is clearer) 
but also functional because we consider that the estimates obtained in the smallest 
basins are subject to additional uncertainty. For instance, stream flow gauge stations are 
located usually in the main streams, and the hydrological model calibration has been 
done at scales that are far from the smallest basins. Also, at the applied resolution (about 
500 m), the geometry of these smallest basins may be badly defined by the simplified 
drainage network. In these cases, a more detailed description would be needed, which is 
out of the regional scope of the two analysed flood warning systems. 
 
6.1. Event of 09 October 2014 
Figure 3 summarizes the results obtained for the Event of 09 October 2014, which is by 
far the most important of the three cases. The figure shows the maximum return period 
obtained over the 48-hour time window by each flood warning system (for the pixels 
with a drainage area over 4 km2). The rainfall accumulation map over the entire region 
is also included. 
Although there was significant rainfall only in part of the region, the 48-hour rainfall 
accumulation exceeds 200 mm over a very large area, and even 600 mm are exceeded 
over an area at the north-east of Genova. The maximum accumulation was observed by 
a raingauge located near Montoggio with a total of 476 mm. 
The two systems identified the maximum return periods in the Bisagno creek, the 
Entella river and the Scrivia river (this last one flowing to the north). Comparing the 
results provided by both systems, the return periods obtained by ERICHA are in general 
smaller. Very high return periods were obtained by Flood-PROOFS in the medium 
 
17
course of the Bisagno creek (over 200 years), where the differences with ERICHA 
(which shows return periods below 100 years) are more evident. 
The results of the event are also presented in terms of the time series of estimated return 
period obtained at 10-min temporal resolution in the most interesting control points 
(shown with thicker circles in Fig. 3). In addition, when a stream gauge exists at the 
place, the warning level associated with the observed flow discharge (1 hour resolution) 
is also included, using the transformation to return period that corresponds to that cell of 
the drainage network. 
Figures 4-6 show the estimated return periods obtained in three control points. The two 
systems obtained very similar results in the Genova control point (Fig. 4), in particular 
the peak (both around 125 years), and they provide a very accurate agreement with the 
return period estimated from flow observations. The coarse time resolution of the flow 
observations (1 hour) does not allow any conclusion about the performance of the 
systems during the rising limb (with 10-min resolution). In the case of the Entella river 
at Panesi (Fig. 5), the warning level provided by Flood-PROOFS (63 years) is quite 
higher than that of the observed flow (5 years), and ERICHA (7 years) provides a more 
reliable estimate. Finally, high warning levels are also obtained in the control point of 
Montoggio in the Scrivia river (Fig. 6), being the return period of Flood-PROOFS (124 
years) higher than that of ERICHA (92 years). Results obtained in Genova and 
Montoggio (return period around 100 years) seem in accordance with the overbank 
inundations actually reported in these places. 
 
6.2. Event of 10 November 2014 
The rainfall accumulation map for this event shows the larger amounts distributed 
around the coast, with two maxima over 200 mm (Figure 7). But only in the Entella 
 
18
river and its tributary Sturla both systems issued significant warnings. Visual 
comparison of the results provided by the systems shows that Flood-PROOFS provides 
in general higher return periods, with maxima over 30 years. 
Figures 8 and 9 show the results obtained in the control points around the Entella river. 
Some differences arise between the results obtained in the two control points. In Panesi 
(on the Entella river with an area of 371 km2) the Flood-PROOFS provides hazard 
levels over 10 years (16), which is quite similar to that provided by the observed flow 
(about 13 years), while the maximum provided by ERICHA is 8 years. But in the case 
of the Carasco control point (outlet of the Sturla river just before flowing into the 
Entella, with 132 km2), the results are more similar (particularly the rise and the time to 
peak), although the ERICHA peak (35 years) is higher than that of Flood-PROOFS (25 
years). Actual overflows were reported in the village of Carasco (confluence of the 
Lavagna and Sturla rivers), while downstream in the Entella river there is no proof of 
overbank inundations. The return periods obtained by both warning systems are in 
accordance with these reported inundations. 
 
6.3. Event of 15 November 2014 
As the other events, the event of 15 November 2014 also shows a rainfall pattern around 
the coast of Liguria (Figure 10), but in this case concentrated mainly in the western part 
of the region. The most significant signal has been obtained in the Polcevera creek, with 
maximum return periods over 100 years estimated using the two warning systems, 
although the river courses where these maxima are located differ from one system to the 
other. 
In this event, only the warning levels obtained in the control points of Pontedecimo 
(Polcevera creek) and Tiglieto (Orba river) are interesting (Figures 11 and 12). In the 
 
19
first case, there are two rainfall peaks having a time lapse of about two hours. While 
Flood-PROOFS reflects these peaks with warning levels over 10 years (22 years in the 
second peak), ERICHA only provides significant warning levels in the second phase (16 
years), showing certain delay with respect to the Flood-PROOFS outputs. It is 
interesting to note that during this event, the Polcevera creek in Pontedecimo and 
downstream actually suffered minor overbank flooding, which seems in accordance 
with the estimated maximum return periods. 
In the case of the Tiglieto control point (Fig. 12), the outputs from both systems are 
quite similar around the peak (19 years for Flood-PROOFS; 16 years for ERICHA). 
And both systems are quite close to the warning level derived from the observed flow 
available at this place (17 years). 
 
6.4. General comparison analysis 
The analysis made at the control points allows us to clearly compare the outputs of the 
two systems. In general, the results obtained at these specific places show significant 
agreement between the two systems, particularly in what regards the evolution during 
the event. 
To extend the analysis to the rest of the domain, the maximum return periods obtained 
over the entire event by each system have been selected. The two resulting return period 
maps have been displayed in a scatter plot. From the total number of pixels of the 
domain, only those belonging to the main drainage network (having a drainage area 
greater than 4 km2) have been selected. 
The idea of this analysis is to study whether the direct comparison (scatter plots of 
Figures 13-15) provides information about the differences and similarities of the two 
warning systems, and if they can be related to other factors. In particular, the analysis 
 
20
focuses on the basin extension (drainage area); the basin itself (since the rainfall-runoff 
model integrated into the Flood-PROOFS is calibrated at basin scale); and the initial 
moisture state of the basin (since this is a key variable to generate surface runoff from 
rainfall in Flood-PROOFS). 
Thus, from the total number of points present in this analysis (6277 points in the main 
drainage network), we have grouped them according to three criteria: (1) their drainage 
area, having more or less than 50 km2 (for clarity purposes only two classes are chosen); 
(2) if they belong or not to one of the five main basins in the selected sub-area of 
Liguria (Bisagno, Scrivia, Entella, Polcevera and Orba); and (3) the average soil 
moisture of the upstream basin at the beginning of the event, simulated at cell scale by 
the Continuum model and expressed as the proportion of the model soil reservoir that is 
full (referred to as Soil Moisture Index, SMI, with 4 classes). 
This last point is more complex than the other two, and requires defining the beginning 
of the rainfall event. But frequently the rainfall events consist of a concatenation of 
rainfall periods with high spatial variability, and the definition of the beginning of the 
event for a large area can be difficult and affected by some subjectivity. Since this 
analysis is focused on the maxima, we have considered that the period that effectively 
affects the peak results corresponds to the previous time window with a duration given 
by the concentration time of the catchment (which is consistent with the background of 
the rainfall-based warning system). Thus, since peak values are achieved at different 
times and concentration times vary at each point of the drainage network, each point has 
been associated with a different state of the soil reservoir simulated by the Continuum 
model. 
 
21
Although the results of the three events are included in this section, the events are 
analysed separately (Figures 13-15). The scatter plot axes show the Gumbel reduced 
variable u, which is related to the return period T (in years) as: 
𝑢= −𝑙𝑛−𝑙𝑛
!!!
!
  
(Eq. 1) 
The upper-right scatter plots of Figures 13-15 do not seem to show any clear 
relationship with the location (see catchment grouping). In fact, the results obtained in 
any of the five analysed catchments present a high scatter. In contrast, the explanation 
of this scatter seems to be mainly due to the points having an associated catchment area 
of less than 50 km2 (upper-left scatter plots). If we keep only the points with a basin 
area greater than this value, a clear trend is observed: in general, ERICHA warning 
levels are smaller than those obtained by Flood-PROOFS, particularly for small return 
periods (almost systematically), while for higher return periods the two warning 
systems present a better agreement (although the general trend remains to be that 
ERICHA return periods are a bit smaller). This result is in accordance to the hypothesis 
highlighted in the introduction that, for small probabilities of occurrence, discharge and 
rainfall probabilities tend to follow the same gradient (for an analysis based on annual 
maxima). 
The analysis grouping the pixels according to the initial soil moisture of the upstream 
catchment (Figures 13-15 bottom) shows a logical evolution after these important 
rainfall events over a period of less than 25 days: while many catchments are relatively 
dry at the beginning of the first event (October 2014), they are almost completely wet at 
the beginning of the third event. In any case, the event of October was characterised by 
a strong rainfall persistence over the affected catchments, and the state of the soil 
reservoir of these catchments was very wet prior to the main rainfall event (SMI higher 
than 0.70). 
 
22
It is interesting to note that, as a general fact, high return periods are not obtained in 
catchments that are dry at the beginning of the event. There are only a few catchments 
having a Soil Moisture Index of less than 0.70 where a return period of 8 years is 
exceeded (u>2). In fact, only a few points having an initial SMI smaller than 0.50 
appear in the scatter plots (mainly in the event of 09 October, Figure 13 bottom panel), 
meaning that at least one of the systems did not obtain a significant return period, and 
thus it is not possible to derive any conclusion for dry conditions. As it has been stated, 
the general trend is that Flood-PROOFS peaks are higher than ERICHA peaks, and this 
is apparent for the points having the largest values of SMI (0.70-1.00), and also for 
medium values of SMI (0.50-0.70). 
In order to somewhat quantify the similarities of the two systems, the Critical Success 
Index (CSI, Schaefer, 1990) between the Flood-PROOFS and ERICHA is computed for 
the peak values over certain thresholds. Usually, the CSI is computed when comparing 
an estimate to an observation, but it can also be used to compare two variables, 
providing a measure of agreement, and the value of the CSI is independent of which is 
used as reference. The CSI has been evaluated over the whole area, and also following 
the classification with the drainage area, catchment pertaining and initial soil moisture.  
Table 1 summarizes the results for return period thresholds of 2, 10 and 20 years. The 2-
years return period could be considered as a proxy for bankfull conditions, and the 10-
years event for a significant flooding. 
One can observe high CSI values in the catchments that were affected by extreme 
floods, as it is the case for Bisagno, Entella and Scrivia in the event of 09 October and 
for Polcevera in the event of 15 November. When CSI is computed for return periods 
over 10 years, then it is clear that better agreement is obtained in the catchments with a 
drainage area over 50 km2 than in smaller catchments. And when looking at the 
 
23
influence of the initial soil moisture, better agreement is obtained in the catchments with 
SMI values higher than 0.70 than in drier catchments (in general it seems to apply for 
all the different return period thresholds tested), but it is probable that the CSI obtained 
for SMI values lesser than 0.70 would be contaminated by the fact that there are too few 
effective points with a related peak over the threshold (for at least one of the warning 
systems), making the CSI computation very sensitive. 
 
7. Discussion and conclusions 
The comparison of the two flood EWS in the three selected events show remarkable 
similarities in the three control points where objective assessment can be performed. 
This similarity is very clear in the case of the event of 9 October 2014 at the Bisagno 
river (Genova) for which both systems produce excellent estimates of the observed 
flows. This agreement with observations supports the quality of the calibration of the 
Flood-PROOFS EWS, which allows it to reproduce even this exceptional flood event 
(return period over 100 years). But it becomes outstanding in the case of ERICHA EWS 
because it only relies on the quality of the rainfall inputs and on the rainfall thresholds 
to estimate the return period probability level (with no other components to be 
calibrated). This can be seen as a good example of the consistency of the GRADEX 
hypothesis for the flood events with high return periods. 
Moreover, all the results at the available control points show quite a good agreement 
between the two EWS in terms of the evolution and magnitude of the estimated hazard 
level. And, from the comparison with the existing flow observations, it is not clear that 
the flow-based flood EWS (Flood-PROOFS) performs better than the rainfall-based 
EWS (ERICHA), specially for high return periods. 
 
24
The representativeness of this comparison is somewhat limited by the fact that the 
observed flow data have been only available at 3 stations, and the time series have been 
compared at 6 selected control points. However, the significance of the selected events 
allows a relevant analysis since it is not common to perform these assessments in events 
with return periods over 10 years. 
When comparing both EWS over the entire domain (the Liguria region), the results 
show more differences. Contrasting the maximum return period obtained at each pixel 
by each one of the systems in a scatter plot, the agreement between Flood-PROOFS and 
ERICHA can be considered low. As a general trend, return periods provided by 
ERICHA are lower than those provided by Flood-PROOFS, although the agreement is 
clearly closer when dealing with extreme floods, particularly for larger catchments 
(above 50 km2). 
It is worth noting that both EWS are affected by the quality of the rainfall inputs. In 
particular, systematic biases (such as those affecting the events of November 2014, Fig 
2) can affect their skill in identifying the areas affected by floods. In this work, the 
uncertainty due to QPE might affect the outputs of the two EWSs and their comparison 
against observations (measured at the 3 stream gauge stations), but much less the 
comparison of the results obtained with the two systems. 
The rainfall-based flood EWS explored in this paper has important similarities with the 
European Precipitation Index EPIC presented by Alfieri et al. (2011). This index is the 
basin-aggregated rainfall normalised by the mean of annual maxima, computed for 
different rainfall durations (6, 12 and 24 h) and keeping the value that provides the 
maximum index. Alfieri and Thielen (2015) made a comparison similar to that shown in 
Figures 13-15, comparing the EPIC index (KPmax) against a parallel KQ index obtained 
from the simulated discharges (obtained with the rainfall-runoff model used in EFAS) 
 
25
normalised by the mean of annual maximum discharges. Their results showed that the 
rainfall index (EPIC) generally provided higher return periods than the flow index (KQ), 
over the full range of results (return periods ranging from 1 to 200 years). Thus, these 
results were notably different than that of the present paper, where the general trend is 
that ERICHA provides lower return periods in front of Flood-PROOFS. 
Raynaud et al. (2015) proposed a sophistication of EPIC to include the effect of the soil 
moisture in the runoff coefficient, and they found that the new index (ERIC) provided 
better agreement against observations than EPIC, so inherently showing the importance 
of including soil moisture information. Contrarily, our results do not show a clear effect 
of the initial soil moisture conditions on the comparison between the two systems. At 
least in part, this can be related to the fact that the basins affected by heavy rainfall were 
quite wet prior to the beginning of the main rainfall event. But it can also be related to 
the own dynamics of the Continuum model during the rainfall event, particularly that of 
the runoff generation. These issues should be addressed in the future, extending the 
comparison to a larger number of events including more varied initial conditions. 
Furthermore, the performance of the rainfall-based flood warning system used in this 
study could be dependent on the duration used to accumulate rainfall. Since this 
duration is related to the concentration time of the basin, the formulation used to obtain 
this parameter might be quite critical. In fact, the concentration time responds to a 
conceptualisation of the basin, and the existent formulations are usually empirical. A 
universally accepted working definition of this parameter is currently lacking, and 
available approaches for the estimation of the time of concentration may yield 
numerical predictions that differ from each other by up to 500% (Grimaldi et al., 2012). 
In our case, using Flood-PROOFS as a reference, the selection of the Kirpich formula 
for the concentration time seem to produce better agreement in terms of the warning 
 
26
level peak than other alternatives, particularly in terms of timing. Our impression is that 
this characteristic time does not have to be strictly referred to the formal definition of 
the concentration time (the time it takes a drop of water to travel from the most distant 
point to reach the outlet), but to a time that allows most of the basin to contribute to the 
hydrograph. In this sense, the Kirpich method, which provides quite short concentration 
times in comparison with other approaches, has resulted to be a good estimate in the 
studied domain. It should be pointed out that the application of the method to other 
areas could require a previous analysis of the concentration time assigned to the basins, 
and this would be an opportunity to essay methods that better exploit the 
geomorphological information. 
The rainfall thresholds used in the rainfall-based EWS (ERICHA) have been obtained 
from historical raingauge series existing at a few specific places. When quality and long 
series are available, good IDF estimates can be obtained at local scales, but several 
difficulties arise when transforming them into basin-aggregated IDF curves, since this 
requires: (i) to spatially interpolate IDF values; and (ii) to apply an "ad-hoc" areal 
reduction factor. A preferred alternative would have been the direct use of long series of 
radar QPEs (not available for this study) to directly compute the statistics of basin-
aggregated rainfall (i.e. basin-aggregated IDF curves; see Panziera, 2016), and thus 
leading to a more consistent set of thresholds for the ERICHA EWS. 
Finally, as in the majority of real cases, in this study we had not enough streamflow 
observations to quantify the real magnitude of the analysed flood events in terms of 
return period at the regional scale (just a few streamflow gauges in the entire region). 
Then, an accurate analysis of the reliability of the compared EWS has been not possible, 
and therefore it has not been possible to elucidate whether one flood warning system is 
 
27
better than the other. However, this study can be considered as a significant test to 
check whether a rainfall-based flood warning system can be reliable and useful. 
In general, if a distributed rainfall-runoff model is properly calibrated for a region (with 
a satisfactory index of agreement against flow observations), if flow thresholds are well 
defined over the whole region and if computer time requirements are not a major 
constraint, this kind of approaches should be firstly recommended. As the rainfall-
runoff model includes the modelling of the different components of the hydrological 
system, an EWS able to forecast flows should be better to reproduce the timing of the 
peaks and provide more confidence and more accurate hazard assessment (particularly 
in minor events). Thus, in these favourable cases, our recommendation is to use a flow-
based EWS. 
If it is not the case (and unfortunately this is not unusual), the results of this study 
support the idea that a rainfall-based flash flood system can be almost as reliable as a 
flow-based system; in particular for basins larger than 50 km2 and when dealing with 
flood events with return periods over 10 years. This is reinforced by the fact that the 
major source of uncertainty in a flash flood EWS is in many cases due to rainfall inputs, 
particularly to rainfall forecasts, and this uncertainty will affect similarly any of these 
EWS.
