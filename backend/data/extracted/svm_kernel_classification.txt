ABSTRACT
The escape of ionizing Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons requires the existence of low-NHI sightlines,
which also promote escape of Lyman-Alpha (Lyα). We use a suite of 2500 Lyα Monte-Carlo radiative
transfer simulations through models of dusty, clumpy interstellar (‘multiphase’) media from Gronke
& Dijkstra (2016), and compare the escape fractions of Lyα (f Lyα
esc ) and LyC radiation (f ion
esc ). We ﬁnd
that f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc
are correlated: galaxies with a low f Lyα
esc
consistently have a low f ion
esc , while galaxies
with a high f Lyα
esc
exhibit a large dispersion in f ion
esc . We argue that there is increasing observational
evidence that Lyα escapes more easily from UV-faint galaxies. The correlation between f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc
then implies that UV-faint galaxies contribute more to the ionizing background than implied by the
faint-end slope of the UV-luminosity function. In multiphase gases, the ionizing escape fraction is
most strongly aﬀected by the cloud covering factor, fcl, which implies that f ion
esc is closely connected to
the observed Lyα spectral line shape. Speciﬁcally, LyC emitting galaxies typically having narrower,
more symmetric line proﬁles. This prediction is qualitatively similar to that for ‘shell models’.

1. INTRODUCTION
The escape fraction of ionizing photons, f ion
esc , repre-
sents one of the key parameters describing cosmic reion-
ization (e.g. Haiman & Holder 2003; Cen 2003; Wyithe
& Loeb 2003; Mitra et al. 2011).
Observational con-
straints on f ion
esc are still weak (see Fig 13 of Smith et al.
2016). Ionizing photons, also known as Lyman Contin-
uum (LyC) photons, have only been directly observed
to escape for a handful of galaxies (e.g. Borthakur et al.
2014; Izotov et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016a, also see
Benson et al.
2013, Smith et al.
2016 and references
therein). Observations of the Lyα forest constrain the
LyC volume emissivity (the rate at which LyC photons
are released into the IGM per unit volume), while ob-
servations of the UV-luminosity function of star form-
ing galaxies provide direct constraints on the produc-
tion rate of LyC photons. These two constraints com-
bined constrain the volume-averaged escape fraction of
ionizing photons, denoted with ⟨f ion
esc ⟩, and show that
⟨f ion
esc ⟩increases with redshift (Inoue et al. 2006; Kuhlen
& Faucher-Gigu`ere 2012; Becker & Bolton 2013).
The LyC escape fraction depends on more than just
redshift.
Various models and simulations predict that
f ion
esc decreases with dark matter halo mass (e.g. Yajima et
al. 2011; Ferrara & Loeb 2013; Paardekooper et al. 2013;
Wise et al. 2014, but also see Gnedin et al. 2008, Ma et
al. 2015, Sharma et al. 2016), which in turn correlates
1 mark.dijkstra@astro.uio.no
with observables such as the non-ionizing UV-continuum
luminosity of galaxies. The reason that not all simula-
tions agree on this mass-dependence is partly because
diﬀerent studies focus on galaxies with very diﬀerent
masses, at very diﬀerent redshifts, and diﬀerent imple-
mentations for sub-grid physics associated with feedback,
which can strongly aﬀect the properties of the simulated
interstellar medium. Ab initio modeling of f ion
esc still rep-
resents a major theoretical challenge (see e.g. Fernandez
& Shull 2011 for a discussion), and models may have
to include additional physical processes such as X-ray
heating/ionization (Benson et al. 2013), runaway stars
(Conroy & Kratter 2012) and binary evolution (Ma et al.
2016), all of which can facilitate the escape of ionizing
photons.
Irrespective of theoretical and observational uncertain-
ties, the escape of ionizing photons requires that paths
exist which contain low column densities of atomic hy-
drogen, i.e. NHI <∼1/σion ≈1017 cm−2, where σion =
6 × 10−18 cm2 denotes the photoionization cross-section
evaluated at the Lyman limit (e.g. Verner et al. 1996).
These same low column density paths provide escape
routes for Lyα photons (Behrens et al. 2014, Verhamme
et al. 2015). LyC and Lyα escape are therefore expected
to be correlated, at least at some level (e.g. Rauch et al.
2011, Erb et al. 2014, Micheva et al. 2016). If the escape
of LyC photons is facilitated by (supernova-driven) winds
that blew low-column density holes (see e.g. Dove et al.
2000, Sharma et al. 2016), then this provides a physi-
cal mechanism connecting f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc , as observations

Dijkstra et al.
of Lyα emitting galaxies indicate that galactic outﬂows
promote the escape of Lyα photons (Kunth et al. 1998,
Atek et al. 2008, Woﬀord et al. 2013, Rivera-Thorsen et
a. 2015, see Hayes 2015 for a review).
The goal of this paper is to more quantitatively ex-
plore the correlation between Lyα and LyC photons, for
which we use a large suite of simpliﬁed models of the
multi-phase ISM that span the wide range of physical
conditions encountered in observed galaxies (ﬁrst pre-
sented in Gronke & Dijkstra 2016). Yajima et al. (2014)
previously found a clear correlation between f Lyα
esc
and
f ion
esc in their cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of
a Milky Way-like galaxy. Their calculations should be
viewed as a ‘bottom-up’ (or ab-initio) approach to quan-
tifying this correlation, while our work should be viewed
as a ‘top-down’ (or empirical) approach. As neither ap-
proach has converged yet (see § 2), our work should be
viewed as complementary to that of Yajima et al. (2014).
Addressing the correlation between f Lyα
esc
and f ion
esc has
become (even) more relevant for cosmic reionization as,
we will argue in § 4.1, there is increasing evidence that
f Lyα
esc
increases towards lower UV-luminosities.
The outline of this paper is as follows: In § 2 we present
our models and show the predicted correlation between
f Lyα
esc
and f ion
esc in § 3. We discuss implications of our re-
sults in § 4, before presenting our conclusions in § 5.
2. THE MODEL
The escape of both ionizing and Lyα photons depends
sensitively on the distribution of neutral gas throughout
the interstellar medium. For Lyα photons, the kinemat-
ics of this neutral gas is possibly even more important
(Kunth et al. 1998, Atek et al. 2008, Steidel et al. 2010,
Woﬀord et al. 2013, Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2015). Mod-
eling Lyα transfer on interstellar scales therefore requires
a proper model for both the distribution and kinemat-
ics of the neutral gas in the ISM, which likely requires
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with sub-pc reso-
lution (e.g. Fujita et al. 2009, Dijkstra & Kramer 2012).
This requirement underlines why it is important to have
a complementary top-down approach to the bottom-up
analysis by Yajima et al. (2014), whose simulations had
a spatial resolution of 250h−1 comoving pc and gas mass
resolution of M = 3 × 105h−1M⊙.
To circumvent the demanding requirements to prop-
erly model interstellar Lyα transfer from ﬁrst principles,
this process has been represented by highly simpliﬁed
models, which include (i) the ‘shell’ model, which con-
sists of a Lyα source surrounded by a geometrically thin
shell of neutral, dusty hydrogen, which is (typically) out-
ﬂowing (see e.g. Ahn et al. 2003, Verhamme et al. 2006,
Gronke et al. 2015a). The shell model -which contains
seven free parameters - has been remarkably successful
at reproducing observed Lyα spectra line proﬁles (e.g.
Verhamme et al.
2008, Hashimoto et al.
2015, Yang
et al. 2016, though some issues have been pointed out
by Barnes & Haehnelt 2010, Kulas et al. 2012, Chonis
et al.
2013); and (ii) the ‘clumpy ISM’ model, which
consists of a (large) collection of spherical clumps that
contain dusty, neutral hydrogen gas, embedded within a
hot inter-clump medium, and which represent simpliﬁed
versions of multiphase interstellar media (e.g. Neufeld
1991, Hansen & Oh 2006, Laursen et al. 2013, Gronke
& Dijkstra 2014). Clumpy models naturally give rise to
a non-zero porosity of the neutral gas, and a ‘continuum
covering factor’ of neutral gas that is less than 100&,
both of which facilitates Lyα escape (e.g. Shibuya et al.
2014, Trainor et al. 2015, Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2015).
Both sets of simpliﬁed models can be interpreted as ‘sub-
grid’ models that describe the Lyα transfer on scales that
have not been modelled yet from ﬁrst principles.
In shell models, the shell completely surrounds the Lyα
source. The escape fraction f ion
esc is determined by its HI
column (NHI) as f ion
esc (ν) = exp[−σion(ν)NHI], and f ion
esc
is practically binary (f ion
esc ≈0 for NHI > 1017 cm−2 or
f ion
esc ≈1.0 for NHI <∼1017 cm−2). However the production
rate of Lyα is zero for f ion
esc ≈1.0, as nebular luminosities
depend on f ion
esc as ∝(1−f ion
esc ) (e.g. Schaerer 2003). The
shell model therefore technically only gives rise to Lyα
emission while f ion
esc ̸= 0 over a ﬁnely tuned narrow range
of NHI centered on NHI ∼1017 cm−2.
Here, we focus on the clumpy ISM models. We have
recently constructed a large library of clumpy models
(Gronke & Dijkstra 2016). In these models, the clumps
have HI column densities large enough to make them
opaque to LyC photons. However, there exist sightlines
that do not penetrate any clumps, and which allow LyC
photons to escape. In clumpy models, f ion
esc is related to
the fraction of sightlines from the LyC source(s) which do
not intersect any clumps (this corresponds to the ‘picket
fence model’ of Heckman et al. 2011).
The geometry of the clumpy ISM model and its the
main parameters are based on that described in Laursen
et al. (2013). We refer the interested reader to these
papers for a more detailed description on how Laursen et
al. (2013) constrain their parameters through observed
galaxies. Here, we only present only a brief description
of the model.
In the clumpy ISM model, the multiphase ISM is rep-
resented by a large number of neutral, spherical ‘clumps’
which are embedded within a hot gas.
The neutral
clumps are distributed in a sphere of radius rgal = 5 kpc.
The clouds themselves have radius rcl. The cloud cover-
ing factor fcl denotes the total number of clouds from the
center of the sphere to its edge, averaged over all sight-
lines. The content of the cold [hot] clumps [inter-clump
medium] is described by Tcl, nHI,cl [TICM, nHI,ICM] for
temperature2 and the number density of hydrogen, re-
spectively. The dust optical optical depth through the
clouds per path-length given by σdZcl/ZsunnHI where
σd = 1.58 × 10−21 cm2 (Pei 1992; Laursen et al. 2009),
where Zcl denotes the ‘metallicity’ of the cloud (the ICM
has metallicity ZICM ≡ζZZcl). Following previous anal-
yses, we assume that there is no further structure to the
cold clumps.
That is, we do not further split up the

is the case for realistic multiphase gases (e.g. McKee &
Ostriker 1977).
The clumps are outﬂowing3 with a velocity proﬁle

for r > rmin = 1 kpc and otherwise zero (Steidel et al.
2010, Laursen et al. 2013). In addition to this, the clouds
have a random, isotropic velocity distribution which is
Gaussian with a standard deviation σcl.
Lyα photons are emitted randomly following an ex-
ponential radial volume emissivity proﬁle ϵLyα(r) =
N exp(−r/Hem) where N is a normalization constang,
and r is the distance to the center of the cloud.
The
photon is emitted inside a cloud with probability Pcl,
which would force it to escape from its birthcloud ﬁrst.
The frequency of the photon is drawn from a Gaussian
with standard deviation σi. In all our models, we assume
the LyC emission traces Lyα emission exactly, including
that a fraction Pcl is emitted inside a neutral clump. The
vast majority of the LyC photons that are emitted inside
a cloud do not to escape.
We thus need 14 parameters to completely character-
ize our models4. Laursen et al. (2013) discuss plausible
ranges for each parameter based on theoretical models,
and observations of the ISM in the Milky Way, nearby
dwarf galaxies, Lyα emitters (LAEs) and drop-out galax-
ies out to z ∼6. Our ﬁducial model adopts the central
value of the range quoted in Laursen et al. (2013) as ‘rea-
sonable’, with the exception of the outﬂow velocity v∞,cl
for which Laursen et al. (2013) chose deliberately small
values. Values for each parameter are listed in Table 1

trum around x = 0, and leaves our fion

Lyα escape fraction.
shown in the Appendix. We assembled a library of 2, 500
spectra (using ∼10, 000 escaped photons each). We drew
each parameter uniformly5 from the range indicated in
Table 1, which is loosely based on the ‘extreme’ range
in Laursen et al. (2013). This choice gives us a suite of
empirical, simpliﬁed models of the multi-phase ISM that
span the wide range of physical conditions encountered
in observed galaxies.
3. RESULTS: CORRELATION BETWEEN fion
esc AND fLyα
esc
Figure 2 shows f ion
esc as a function of f Lyα
esc . Each cross
represents a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulation
for one random realization of a clumpy ISM model. The
color of the cross denotes fcl.
There are several take-away points from this plot.
1. The 2500 models give rise to signiﬁcant variation in
f Lyα
esc
(which spans ∼3 orders of magnitude) and f ion
esc
(which spans ∼4 orders of magnitude). Models that
give rise to f Lyα
esc
>∼0.1−0.2 would correspond to galax-
ies with relatively ‘strong’ Lyα emission, such as Lyα
emitters. Our models therefore give rise to a popu-
lation of ‘Lyα emitters’ and weaker Lyα sources such
as drop-out galaxies with weak Lyα emission. Our re-
sults also indicate that for at ﬁxed f Lyα
esc , the dispersion
in f ion
esc can be large.
2. When f Lyα
esc
is small, then f ion
esc is small. Lyα photons
are destroyed most eﬃciently when they encounter,
and scatter in, many diﬀerent clumps. The number
of scattering events (or ‘cloud interactions’) scales as
Ncl ∝f 2
cl (fcl ≫1, Hansen & Oh 2006).
If fcl is
larger, then the Poission probability of having clear
sightlines becomes exponentially smaller:

son probability that a sightline from r = 0 inter-
sects zero clumps equals6 P(Nclump = 0|fcl, r = 0) =

(1 −Pcloud) exp(−fcl), where 1 −Pcloud denotes the
probability that the LyC photon was not emitted in-
side a cloud.
This result may make it diﬃcult to explain inferred
f ion
esc ∼0.1 −0.2 for a small subset LBGs (e.g. Iwata
et al.
2009, Micheva et al.
2016).
This apparent
discrepancy can be alleviated in ﬁve ways: (i) reso-
nant scattering of Lyα oﬀresidual HI gas in the dif-
fuse IGM can suppress the observed Lyα ﬂux by an
additional factor of 1.5 −2.0 depending on redshift
(e.g. Laursen et al. 2011), which should be applied to
our predicted f Lyα
esc
when comparing to observations;
(ii) the fraction of LBGs with claimed LyC detections
is very small, which suggests this population is rare,
and not captured by our analysis in spite of our cov-
erage of a broad range of ISM physical conditions;
(iii) While LBGs generally have smaller f Lyα
esc
than
LAEs, f Lyα
esc
appears correlated with the Lyα EW (e.g.
Trainor et al. 2015, Micheva et al. 2016), which itself
scales as EW∝(1−f ion
esc )f Lyα
esc
(see § 4.4).
This sug-
gests that those LBGs that show LyC leakage, may in
fact have larger f Lyα
esc
than the LBG population as a
whole; (iv) For very large f ion
esc , the production rate
of Lyα decreases, which mimicks a low f Lyα
esc
(see § 4.4
for more discussion on this); (v) Each cross in Fig-
ure 2 represents an angle-average of the escape frac-
tions for each of the 2500 models. The ‘apparent’ f ion
esc
can be larger along sightlines which do not intersect
any clumps. The Lyα escape fraction can also be en-
hanced for these same sightlines, though scattering of
the Lyα emissivity proﬁle ϵLyα(r) must take into account that the
probability P(Nclump = 0|fcl, r) depends on emission direction for
r ̸= 0. This makes the expression for P(Nclump = 0|fcl) a bit more
complicated but preserves the exponential dependence on fcl.
Lyα photons suppresses the angular variation of f Lyα
esc
(see Gronke & Dijkstra 2014). The angular variation
of both escape fraction can be represented by replac-
ing each cross in Figure 2 with a distribution which
is elongated along the f ion
esc -direction, which may help
explain that objects exist for which f ion
esc is high, while
f Lyα
esc
is low.
3. The dispersion in f ion
esc at ﬁxed f Lyα
esc
increases with
f Lyα
esc . In other words, as we increase f Lyα
esc
the prob-
ability of having a large f ion
esc increases. There are a
number of ways to boost f Lyα
esc . These include reduc-
ing the dust content of the neutral clumps, increasing
the outﬂow velocity, and reducing fcl. As mentioned
above, reducing fcl enhance the Poisson probability
that there exist sightlines that do not intersect any
clumps, which increases f ion
esc . Matthee et al. (2016b)
recently found f ion
esc >∼60% for 8 Hα emitters (HAEs)
out of a sample of 191. Two of these LyC emitting
HAEs have a high f Lyα
esc
(Matthee et al. 2016a). For
the remaining 6 the Lyα is not good enough (yet) to
constrain f Lyα
esc .
4. The color coding of the crosses in Figure 2 show clearly
that high f ion
esc are those with low fcl. This again re-
ﬂects that a lower average number density of clouds
from the center to the edge of the ‘galaxy’ boosts the
Poisson probability for having clean sightlines.
The strong fcl-dependence of f ion
esc is easily understood
from analytic arguments. The simulations indicate that
this result is not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by varying the
other parameters. The black dashed line shows the best
linear ﬁt through the collection of data points. We stress
that the purpose of this line is to illustrate that f ion
esc and
f Lyα
esc
are correlated. The exact ‘best-ﬁt’ correlation de-
pends on how the 14 model-parameters were sampled:
diﬀerent PDFs for the model parameters would likely
yield a diﬀerent best-ﬁt correlation. This may help ex-
plain that our correlation diﬀers quantitatively from that
found by Yajima et al. (2014), who found few objects
with high f Lyα
esc
and low f ion
esc . This diﬀerence may also
reﬂect that (i) the simulations do not resolve the multi-
phase interstellar medium, and may therefore not prop-
erly capture that Lyα photons avoid destruction by dust
by scattering oﬀthe surface of dense, neutral clumps
which contain most of the dust, (ii) that our model ar-
tiﬁcially enhances this surface scattering eﬀect, by rep-
resenting the multi-phase ISM as a two-phase medium.
We stress that the purpose of our calculations was not to
derive the correct correlation, which would be overambi-
tious, but rather to show that for reasonable parameters
for the multiphase ISM, a correlation exists.
Finally,
it is worth mentioning that the fact that both f ion
esc and
f Lyα
esc
are aﬀected most strongly by fcl implies that the
precise structure of the clumps (i.e. the presence of a
‘cold neutral medium’ inside the clumps), would intro-
duce changes that are subdominant to those introduced
by fcl.
4. DISCUSSION
The Lyα-LyC Connection
5
4.1. The MUV-dependence of f Lyα
esc
The ‘Lyα fraction’ denotes the fraction of galaxies that
have a Lyα emission line stronger than some threshold
equivalent width.
Observations indicate that the Lyα
fraction increases with MUV (e.g.
Stark et al.
2010,
Pentericci et al.
2011, Caruana et al.
2012, Ono et
al. 2012, Schenker et al. 2012, Pentericci et al. 2014,
Caruana et al. 2014). Gronke et al. (2015b) combined
observations of the UV-LF with current constraints on
the UV-dependence of the Lyα fraction, and predicted
that Lyα-LFs should be have steeper faint ends than the
UV-LFs.
Speciﬁcally, if we denote the faint-end slope
of the Lyα LF with αLyα, then αLyα = αUV −x where
x ∼0.2 −0.4 (see Fig 2 of Gronke et al. 2015b). Recent
measurements of faint end slope of Lyα emitter luminos-
ity functions at z = 5.7 indicate that αLyα ∼−2.2 ± 0.2
(Dressler et al. 2015), and that αLyα ∼−1.75 ± 0.1 at
z ∼2 (Konno et al. 2016). These measurements agree
well7 with prediction using Lyα fraction constraints, and
provides independent conﬁrmation that more Lyα radi-
ation emerges per ‘unit’ UV-ﬂux density towards lower
UV luminosities.
This enhanced emergence of Lyα ﬂux from UV-faint
galaxies implies that (i) the Lyα production rate in-
creases, and/or (ii) f Lyα
esc
increases towards lower UV-
luminosities. Recent work has shown that at z ∼4 the
ionizing photon production eﬃciency, ξion (Robertson et
al. 2013), appears to be independent of MUV in the range
−21 < MUV < −19 at z ∼4−5 (see Fig 1 of Bouwens et
al. 2016, which also shows that there is still a large scat-
ter). The Lyα production eﬃciency should then also not
depend on MUV, as Lyα production is directly tied to
ionizing photon production. In contrast, over this same
range in MUV, the Lyα fraction rises rapidly (see Fig 13
of Stark et al. 2010). This suggests that the enhanced
visibility of Lyα ﬂux is mostly driven by an enhanced
escape fraction, and provides the basis for our statement
that there is observational support that f Lyα
esc
increases
towards lower UV-luminosities (or towards higher MUV).
Trainor et al. (2015) note that in LAEs with Hα detec-
tions, the inferred f Lyα
esc
correlates signiﬁcantly with Lyα
EW, which provides independent conﬁrmation that Lyα
EW is an indicator of Lyα escape.
Oyarz´un et al. (2016) recently found that the Lyα-
EW PDF, and therefore the Lyα fraction, depends on
stellar mass, M∗. This supports that f Lyα
esc
increases to-
wards lower M∗. Our ﬁnding of a correlation between
f Lyα
esc
and f ion
esc then implies that f ion
esc also increases to-
wards lower M∗. Faisst (2016) independently came to
this conclusion by combining the observed correlation
between f ion
esc and the [O III]λ5007/[O II]λ3727 line ra-
tio, and the (anti-)correlation of this line ratio with M∗
inferred from local high-z analogues. We stress that we
focus on the MUV-dependence of f ion
esc because this al-
7 Gronke et al. (2015b) only predicted Lyα LFs at z ≥3. We
extrapolated their predictions for αLyα to z ∼2. This same extrap-
olation would translate to a faint-end slope of the UV-luminosity
function at z ∼2.3 that is αUV ∼−1.5, which agrees with re-
cent determinations (see Fig 10 of Parsa et al.
2016), though
not all (see e.g.
Reddy & Steidel 2009, who found a steeper
αUV = −1.73 ± 0.07).
Fig. 3.— An increase in fion
esc towards lower UV luminosities gives
rise to a steepening of the LyC luminosity function (LF), which can
be mimicked with a steeper UV LF and a constant fion
esc . The top
panel of this Figure shows the relative contribution dϵion/dMUV
(in arbitrary units) to the ionizing volume emissivity ϵion at z = 6
by galaxies with MUV ± dMUV/2 for the measured αUV = −1.85
(black solid line), and steeper LFs with αUV = −2.25 (blue dotted
line) and αUV = −2.05 (red dashed line). While we cannot pre-
dict (yet) which αUV mimicks the true MUV-dependence of fion
esc ,
this plot visually illustrates the enhanced contribution of UV-faint
galaxies to cosmic reionization. The lower panel shows the ratio
between the models in the top panel and the ﬁducial model (shown
as the black solid line).
lows us to directly connect our results to the UV-LF of
continuum selected galaxies, which is routinely used to
quantify the LyC volume emissivity of galaxies during
cosmic reionization.
4.2. Implications for Reionization
One of the main open questions in reionization is
whether galaxies provided enough photons to reionize the
Universe, and if so, which galaxies provided the dominant
contribution to the ionizing background that drove reion-
ization. These questions are commonly addressed by ex-
trapolating the faint-end of the (non-ionizing) UV-LF of
drop-out galaxies to some minimum UV luminosity (cor-
responding to a maximum M lim
UV), and then see whether
theses galaxies provided enough photons to either reion-
ize the Universe, or to keep it ionized (e.g. Wilkins et al.
2011; Shull et al. 2012; Kuhlen & Faucher-Gigu`ere 2012;
Finkelstein et al. 2012a; Robertson et al. 2013).
This
approach introduces two parameters related to the UV-
LF: (i) its faint end slope (αUV), and (ii) its minimum
cut-oﬀluminosity (M lim
UV). For a ﬁxed set of parameters
(αUV, M lim
UV), the question whether galaxies reionized the
Universe then translates to a constraint on f ion
esc . This
constraint on f ion
esc represents a (weighted) average over
the full population of UV emitting galaxies. There have
been numerous theoretical eﬀorts to model the faint end
slope of the UV-LF and where it may ﬂatten (e.g. Jaacks
et al. 2013, Mason et al. 2015, O’Shea et al. 2015, Liu
et al. 2016).
If Lyα and LyC escape are correlated, then we also ex-
pect f ion
esc to increase towards lower UV luminosities. Just
6
Dijkstra et al.
like the case for Lyα, if we were to plot the LyC luminos-
ity function (i.e. the number density of galaxies as a func-
tion of LyC luminosity), it would be steeper than the UV
luminosity function. This steepening can be mimicked
by a model in which f ion
esc does not depend on MUV, and
in which the faint-end slope of the UV-luminosity func-
tion is made steeper.
Figure 3 visually illustrates the
impact of this steepening, and the top panel shows the
relative contribution dϵion/dMUV to the ionizing volume
emissivity ϵion by galaxies in the range MUV ± dMUV/2.
The black solid line shows dϵion/dMUV for the ‘standard’
Schechter function parameters at z = 6, (αUV, M∗) =
(−1.85, −20.2) (using the ﬁtting formula from Bouwens
et al. 2015). For the blue dotted line [red dashed line] we
increased αUV →−2.25, which represents the steepening
relevant for the Lyα LF [αUV →−2.05, which represents
an intermediate case]. While we do not know which αUV
mimicks the correct MUV dependence of f ion
esc , it does il-
lustrate the possible enhanced contribution of UV-faint
galaxies to cosmic reionization8. The enhancement is il-
lustrated in the lower panel of Figure 3 which shows the
ratio of the models shown in the top panel. This plot
shows that in a model with αUV = −2.25 galaxies with
MUV ∼−16 contribute
>∼10 times more to the total
ionizing photon production rate than when α = −1.85.
This model extends down to MUV = −14, which corre-
sponds (roughly) to the limit to which the UV-LF has
been constraint to be a power-law (see e.g Alavi et al.
2014; Parsa et al. 2016; Livermore et al. 2016, also see
O’Shea et al. 2015 and Liu et al. 2016 for theoretical
arguments why the UV-LF may ﬂatten at MUV >∼−14).
Finally, Lyα escape in clumpy ISM models – which
were introduced to reﬂect the multi-phase nature of the
ISM – is most strongly regulated by covering factor, and
to a lesser extent by other parameters such as the dust
content (Gronke & Dijkstra 2016). Star forming galax-
ies are known to become bluer towards higher redshift,
which is taken as evidence that star forming galaxies get
less dusty towards higher redshifts (e.g. Finkelstein et
al. 2012b; Bouwens et al. 2012). Our conclusions would
break down if Lyα escape were driven entirely by the
changing dust content of an otherwise identical scatter-
ing medium. In this case however, we would expect both
the width and (possibly) velocity shift of the Lyα line to
increase with MUV, because Lyα scattering causes pho-
tons to diﬀuse in frequency space, and to broaden the
Lyα spectral line shape.
If only dust were regulating
Lyα escape, then dust would suppress this frequency dif-
fusion and cause lines to be narrower (see e.g. Fig 8 of
Laursen et al. 2009). The evolution in Lyα line width
and shift predicted by the ‘pure dust’ scenario is not con-
sistent with observations which indicate that Lyα spectra
of Lyα emitting galaxies, if anything, tend to get nar-
rower: Konno et al. (2016) have shown that shell-model
ﬁts to observed Lyα line proﬁles favor increasingly low HI
column densities towards higher z for otherwise identical
shell model parameters. The reduced HI column density
introduces less frequency diﬀusion, and makes Lyα line
8 Decreasing α reduces the contribution of UV-bright galaxies,
i.e. MUV < M∗, to dϵion/dMUV because reducing α also aﬀects
the bright end of the luminosity function.
proﬁles narrower9.
In addition, there is observational
support that the covering factor of low-ionization metal
lines decreases with z (e.g. Jones et al. 2013). If these
metals trace cold, neutral gas, then this supports the no-
tion that Lyα escape increases towards higher redshift
(at least partly) because of the evolution in the covering
factor of neutral gas.
4.3. Connection f ion
esc to the Lyα Spectrum
Figure 2 showed that f ion
esc depends sensitively on fcl,
which was due to the exponential dependence on fcl
of the Poisson probability of having sightlines with no
clumps. The parameter fcl is known to play a key role
in Lyα transfer through clumpy media (Hansen & Oh
2006). We have demonstrated that fcl is one the 14 pa-
rameters of the clumpy models that most strongly aﬀects
the emerging Lyα spectrum (Gronke & Dijkstra 2016).
This implies immediately that f ion
esc should be closely cor-
related with spectral features of the Lyα line.
Figure 4 compares Lyα spectra for 25 models with the
highest f ion
esc > 0.37 (right panel) to 25 models with the
lowest f ion
esc < 10−4 (left panel). These two panels illus-
trate clearly that a high f ion
esc corresponds to having nar-
rower, more symmetric Lyα lines. Models that have the
highest f ion
esc show a variety in their spectra. We caution
that the width and velocity oﬀ-set of the models with
the lowest f ion
esc are larger than what has been observed.
This is likely an artefact of the models: models with the
lowest f ion
esc have the highest fcl ∼8. Lyα photons typ-
ically scatter oﬀ∼f 2
CL separate clouds before escaping
(e.g. Hansen & Oh 2006), and each ‘cloud-interaction’
can impart of noticeable Doppler boost on the Lyα pho-
ton, which broadens the Lyα spectral line.
The connection between the Lyα spectral shape and
ionizing photon escape was pointed out previously by
Behrens et al.
(2014, in the context of modiﬁed shell
models) and Verhamme et al. (2015, in the context of
shell models). In these models, LyC escape translated
to (i) signiﬁcant Lyα ﬂux at systemic velocity and/or
(ii) a small peak separation (∆v <∼300 km s−1).
In
multiphase models, it is not possible to point out fea-
tures in the spectrum that guarantee a LyC detection,
partly because of the larger variety in the spectra asso-
ciated with models that have larger f ion
esc . In addition,
in clumpy models Lyα photons can escape after scat-
tering oﬀa single gas cloud, and close to the frequency
at which they were initially emitted (also see Hansen&
Oh 2006, Laursen et al.
2013).
Moreover, while nar-
row Lyα lines that are symmetric around the systemic
velocity of the host galaxy translate to a higher prob-
ability of being a LyC emitting galaxy, LyC escape is
highly anisotropic (Lyα escape less so, see Gronke & Di-
jkstra 2014), which further complicates making robust
predictions for whether we can observe LyC ﬂux from a
galaxy or not. However, anisotropic escape of LyC pho-
tons similarly aﬀects other promising LyC-leakage indi-
9 Also, the velocity oﬀ-set of the peak ﬂux density of the Lyα
spectral line shape decreases towards UV-fainter galaxies (e.g. Erb
et al. 2014; Song et al. 2014).

esc Lyα spectra are redshifted, asymmetric, and broad.
The width and velocity oﬀ-set of the models with the lowest fion

simpliﬁed representation of the multiphase ISM (see text). Although models with high fion

cators10 such as the [O III]λ5007/[O II]λ3727 line ratio
(Jaskot & Oey 2013, Nakajima & Ouchi 2014).
The low-redshift ‘Lyman Break Analogue’ (LBA,
Heckman et al. 2011, Borthakur et al. 2015) and ‘green
pea galaxy’ (Henry et al. 2015, Yang et a. 2016, Izotov
et al. 2016) with reported detections of LyC escape, had
unusual Lyα spectra in the sense that the spectra con-
tained signiﬁcant ﬂux blueward of Lyα resonance. These
spectra were diﬀerent than those shown in Figure 4 in
that they had deep ‘absorption’ troughs separating the
blue and red peaks, which are absent from the spectra in
Figure 4. The absence of these absorption troughs in the
theoretical spectra may reﬂect the lack trace amounts of
residual HI (possibly in the CGM) at systemic velocity
(see Gronke & Dijkstra 2016). In any case, the presence
of ﬂux blueward of the Lyα resonance indicates that the
lines are more symmetric around the Lyα resonance than
is common.
4.4. Suppressed Lyα Production for large f ion
esc
The Lyα production rate scales as ∝(1−f ion
esc ). The
total Lyα ﬂux that we receive from a distant galaxy, as
well as the equivalent width (EW) of the line, both scale
as ∝(1−f ion
esc )f Lyα
esc .

cannot exceed (1−f ion

esc there exists a distribution of
f Lyα
esc (1−f ion
esc ), which reﬂects the dispersion in f Lyα
esc . The
average of this distribution peaks at some maximum

ation ﬁeld in close proximity to star forming galaxies, which can
increase the surface brightness in ﬂuorescent Lyα and Hα emission
(see Mas-Ribas & Dijkstra 2016).
f ion
esc,max (also see Dijkstra et al.
2014).
The value of
f ion
esc,max is model-dependent, and even in the context
of our model it depends on how we sampled our 14
parameters. It nevertheless seems reasonable to assume
that f ion
esc,max∼0.1 −0.5. For large f ion
esc >f ion
esc,max the Lyα
luminosity drops again, which mimicks a reduction in
f Lyα
esc . We expect this ‘apparent’ reduction in the escape
fraction to translate to a reduction in the Lyα fraction
and/or a ﬂattening of the Lyα luminosity function at
low Lyα luminosities11. No evidence for either this drop
or this ﬂattening exists at z ∼6 in current data (though
it may be present at z 6.5, see Fig 7 of Matthee et al.
2015), which implies that this eﬀect is not important
in current observations at z ∼6. More quantitatively,
Dressler et al.
(2015) infer a steep faint end slope of
the LAE LF down to Lα < 1042 erg s−1.
Gronke et
al.
(2015b) show that Lyα luminosity of Lα ∼1042
erg s−1 probes galaxies with MUV ∼−18 ± 1 (see their
Fig 3).
This therefore implies hat f ion
esc <f ion
esc,max, and
that therefore this eﬀect is not important, down to
MUV ∼−18 ± 1.
At z > 6 there is observational evidence for a reduc-
tion in the Lyα ﬂux from star forming galaxies compared
to expectations based on extrapolations from lower red-
shift observations (see e.g. Dijkstra 2014 and references
therein).
There are indications that this reduction is
more severe for UV-faint galaxies (e.g. Ono et al. 2012,
Pentericci et al. 2014), which is commonly interpreted
as a signature of inhomogeneous reionization, but might
also reﬂect that f ion
esc →f ion
esc,max in UV-faint galaxies at
z ∼7 (also see Dijkstra et al.
2014).
It is theoreti-
cally possible to distinguish between these two scenarios:
(i) reionization leaves a unique signature on the angu-
11 Although a ﬂattening has possibly been detected at z ∼3
by Rauch et al. (2008) at Lα ∼1041 erg s−1, which would probe
galaxies with MUV ∼−15 ± 1 (see Gronke et al. 2015 for a discus-
sion).

Subaru’s Hyper-Suprime Cam12 (see e.g. Jensen et al.
2014, Sobacchi & Mesinger 2015), (ii) if Lyα disappears
as a result of f ion
esc becoming large, then we should see a
similar decrease in the line strength of other non-resonant
nebular lines such as Hα (and Hβ), something that can
be tested with the James Webb Space Telescope13 (Gard-
ner et al. 2006).
Redshift z ∼6 is particularly interesting as reioniza-
tion likely had little impact on the observed Lyα ﬂux
from galaxies. Should future data reveal a ﬂattening in
the Lyα LF at low Lyα luminosities and/or a reduction in
the Lyα fraction at lower UV-luminosities, then this may
provide a valuable constraint on f ion
esc at this redshift. In
addition, understanding whether f ion
esc introduces a ﬂat-
tening in the Lyα LF at low Lyα luminosities and/or a
drop in the Lyα fraction at faint UV luminosities, would
help us better constrain the role that reionization plays
in suppressing the Lyα ﬂux from galaxies at z > 6.
4.5. Impact of Delayed Lyα Escape due to Trapping
The escape fraction of LyC photons from a galaxy can
vary signiﬁcantly on time-scales of ∼10 Myr (Kimm &
Cen 2014; Ma et al. 2015), which corresponds approxi-
mately to the life-time of massive stars. Trapping of Lyα
photons by HI gas can introduce a lag in the escape of
Lyα and LyC photons (Yajima & Li 2014): Lyα photons
scatter inside HI gas when f ion
esc ≪1, but are ‘released’
12 http://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/
13 http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/
eﬃciently when low-column channels temporarily open-
up, which allow LyC photons to escape. Time-variations
in f ion
esc and delayed escape of Lyα has only a minor, pos-
itive, impact on our results by slightly more tightly cou-
pling f Lyα
esc
and f ion
esc , as we explain below.
Trapping of Lyα photons is limited to time-scales
ttrap ≪10 Myr, as the typical Lyα trapping time equals
ttrap = |xp|tcross, where tcross ≡R/c denotes the time it
takes radiation to escape in the absence of scattering,
and |xp| ≈12(NHI/1020 cm−2)1/3(T/104 K)1/6 for a
static, uniform, spherical gas cloud with an HI column
density NHI and temperature T (Adams, 1975).
In
reality, this estimate provides a strict upper limit to the
delay time: velocity gradients, density inhomogeneities
reduce ttrap (Bonilha et al. 1979, Dijkstra & Loeb 2008).
Laursen et al. (2013) evaluated that the typical trapping
time for Lyα in clumpy media considered here to be
ttrap ∼2 × 104 yr. Trapping of Lyα photons is therefore
unlikely to introduce a lag between the escape of Lyα
and LyC photons at a level where it has observable
consequences. Moreover, if anything, this eﬀect would
serve to more tightly couple Lyα and LyC escape, as
LyC escape would be accompanied with the escape of
Lyα photons that were trapped inside the HI gas.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The escape fraction of ionizing photons, f ion
esc , repre-
sents one of the great unknowns in our understanding
of cosmic reionization. Observational constraints on f ion
esc
are still weak, and theoretical predictions remain incom-
plete owing to the challenging nature of the calcula-
tions.
We have computed the correlation between the
escape fractions of Lyα (f Lyα
esc ) and ionizing (LyC) ra-
diation (f ion
esc ) by performing Monte-Carlo simulations of
Lyα radiative transfer through a suite of 2500 models of
dusty, clumpy interstellar media. This represents a ‘top-
down’ (empirical) approach to modelling LyC and Lyα
transfer through realistic, multiphase interstellar media,
and complements the previous ‘bottom-up’ (ab initio)
approach by Yajima et al. (2014), who used hydrody-
namical simulations to generate models of the ISM. Our
main results are:
• We ﬁnd that f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc
are correlated.
The
dispersion in f ion
esc at ﬁxed f Lyα
esc
increases towards larger
f Lyα
esc :
galaxies with low f Lyα
esc
have a low f ion
esc , while
galaxies with high f Lyα
esc
show a large spread in f ion
esc (see
Fig 2). The dispersion in f ion
esc is driven by the disper-
sion in fcl, which measures the cloud covering factor.
Our results agree qualitatively with those obtained by
Yajima et al (2014, who also found a positive correla-
tion), but quantitatively some diﬀerences remain, which
reﬂects that neither approach has converged yet (see the
discussion in § 2).
While predictions of both f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc
are still highly
uncertain, the existence of a correlation between the
two quantities can be predicted more robustly, which
is underlined by the fact that two diﬀerent, indepen-
dent approaches conﬁrm the existence of this correla-

tion. The f Lyα
esc -f ion
esc correlation reﬂects that the escape
of ionizing photons requires that sightlines exist which
contain low column densities of atomic hydrogen, i.e.
NHI <∼1/σion ≈1017 cm−2. These same-low column den-
sity paths provide escape routes for Lyα photons (also
see Behrens et al. 2014, Verhamme et al. 2015). At a
deeper level, the escape of Lyα is facilitated by outﬂows,
which may also create low column density holes out of
galaxies, which in turn permit LyC photons to escape.
• We argued that the positive correlation between f ion
esc
and f Lyα
esc
is directly relevant for studies of cosmic reion-
ization, as there is increasing observational support from
both continuum and line selected galaxies that Lyα es-
capes more easily from UV-faint galaxies (see § 4.1).
The correlation between f ion
esc and f Lyα
esc
then implies that
ionizing photons also escape more easily from UV-faint
galaxies at this redshift.
This implies that UV-faint
galaxies contribute more to the volume emissivity of ion-
izing photons than implied by the faint-end slope of the
UV-luminosity function (§ 4.2). These conclusions may
be invalidated if the escape of Lyα is regulated purely by
dust. However, we argued in § 4.2 that observations do
not support this picture.
• Because
the
‘apparent’
Lyα
escape
frac-
tion,
f Lyα
esc (1−f ion
esc ),
reaches a maximum value for
f ion
esc =f ion
esc,max∼0.1 −0.5 (see § 4.4), we expect a drop
in the Lyα fraction at lower UV-luminosities and/or a
ﬂattening of the Lyα LF at lower Lyα luminosities, if
f ion
esc continues to rise monotonically. This has not been
observed yet at z ∼6 (but possibly at z ∼6.5, see
Matthee et al. 2015), which implies that f ion
esc <f ion
esc,max in
galaxies with MUV ∼−18 ± 1. The observed reduction
in Lyα ﬂux from galaxies at z > 6 may be partly due
to f ion
esc approaching f ion
esc,max (also see Dijkstra et al.
2014). LAE clustering measurements and observations
of Balmer lines can help determine the role of f ion
esc in
the disappearance of Lyα emission from galaxies at z >∼6
(see § 4.4).
• Figure 2 also shows that the ionizing escape fraction
is strongly aﬀected by the cloud covering factor, fcl. As a
result, f ion
esc is closely connected to the observed Lyα spec-
tral line shape (see § 4.3) with LyC emitting objects typi-
cally having narrower, more symmetric Lyα lines (Fig 4,
also see Erb et al. 2014). In multiphase models, LyC
emitting object exhibit a wide range of spectral line pro-
ﬁles, and it is not possible to identify spectral features
that ‘guarantee’ a LyC detection.
Lyα emitting galaxies are valuable for constraining the
ionization state of the intergalactic medium (see e.g. Di-
jkstra 2014, and references therein). Our work implies
that these galaxies also provide unique insights into the
nature of the sources that reionized the Universe, in spite
of the fact that modeling interstellar Lyα radiative trans-
fer remains highly challenging. We emphasize that our
results diﬀer from previous works which estimated the
contribution of LAEs to cosmic reionization (see e.g. Ya-
jima et al. 2014): LAEs represent a subset of galaxies
within a limited range of MUV and with a (relatively)
large f Lyα
esc
(and hence f ion
esc ), where the precise range in
MUV and f Lyα
esc
both depend on the minimum Lyα lumi-
nosity and Lyα EW of the LAE sample of interest. In
addition, the contribution of LAEs to cosmic reioniza-
tion depends sensitively on Lyα EW-PDF as a function
of MUV, which is not well constrained, especially at faint
MUV. Here, we make a more general (and robust) point
that the faint-end of the LAE LF helps constrain the
MUV-dependence of f Lyα
esc
and by extension, f ion
esc .
In the next years, the number of Lyα emitting galaxies
at z ∼5.7 −7 is anticipated to grow by ∼1 −2 orders
of magnitude with surveys performed on Subaru’s Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC). Moreover, integral-ﬁeld unit spec-
trographs such as MUSE14 will enable us to detect fainter
Lyα emitting sources and better constrain the faint-end
slope of Lyα emitter luminosity function, and also better
characterize the (sometimes spatially resolved) spectra of
Lyα emission lines. Recent spectroscopic observations of
gravitationally lensed galaxies (e.g.
Treu et al.
2015,
Schmidt et al.
2016, Vanzella et al.
2016b) have un-
covered several (intrinsically) UV-faint galaxies with a
prominent Lyα emission line, and/or other spectral fea-
tures such as a high [O III]λ5007/[O II]λ3727 line ratio,
which favor LyC escape (Huang et al.
2016, Vanzella
et al.
2016b).
These observations -which support the
case for an enhanced contribution of UV faint galaxies
to cosmic reionization- provide a preview of what will be
routinely possible with the next generation of ground-
based telescopes such as the European Extremely Large
Telescope (E-ELT)15, the Thirty Meter Telescope16, and
the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT)17.

APPENDIX
MODEL PARAMETERS
Table 1 provides an overview of the 14 parameters that are needed to fully characterize the multi-phase media. The
second row contains the ﬁducial value for each parameter, which was taken from Laursen et al. (2013). The third row
indicates the range of values from which we randomly drew model parameters.
